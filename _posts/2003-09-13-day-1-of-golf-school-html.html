excerpt: " It was a long, hot, but fun day here in the greater Phoenix area.  Steve
  and I spent the morning and afternoon at golf school with our great instructor Ubie
  Gentile.  It typically takes a few weeks for intense lessons like this to settle
  in and impact my game in a positive way.  For now I'm just a jumble of different
  swing thoughts.     Here are a few of the things I need to work on for my own references:
  \   My setup with my irons and fairway woods needs to be more balanced.  Currently
  I have too much right-tilt, which is appropriate off the tee.   I need to lower
  my hands in all of my full swing shots.  Let them hang down naturally to find their
  proper position.   My grip was a bit too neutral - need to be a bit weaker.   With
  my height and flexibility, I need to be careful not to over-swing.  Ubie recommends
  about a 75-80% effort on my swings to get more under control and maintain repeatable
  ball flight.   Perhaps my biggest challenge right now is a lower body that is too
  busy.  Work on keeping it still, particularly my knees.   Maintain a strong finish.
  \     Today we played 18 holes at Las Sendas after our lessons, 9 of them with Ubie. 
  Playing the course with the pro is always the highlight, since I appreciate hearing
  about course management, shot selection, and dealing with the variable conditions
  on the course.  Tomorrow we'll play 9 at Last Sendas and as many holes as we can
  stand at the Arizona Golf Resort. "
