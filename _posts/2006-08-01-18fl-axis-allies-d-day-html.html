excerpt: 'I recently had one my best gaming experiences in a long while – a game of
  18FL with Tim, Wes and Eric.  You can read all about the details of the session
  over at Eric’s weblog, so I’ll use this space to talk about why I had so much fun
  and why I just placed an order for 1850.  The itch to play an 18xx game has been
  with me for at least a couple of years.  I even bought a used copy of 1830 on eBay
  a while back, a largely uninformed purchase that I now regret.  Eric got a similar
  itch and has had Tim around to help him scratch it – they even attended an 18xx
  mini-convention here in Portland recently.  April – July weekends are largely consumed
  with baseball for me so I was unable to attend. I arrived a bit early so was able
  to check out the components – very impressive for what is nearly a print-on-demand
  boardgame publisher.  Eric uses his on poker chips for the money but I think he
  regrets not including money in his customized order.  I had a hard time remembering
  what denominations matched what colors at times.  Allow me to explain the basics
  of 18FL.  I don’t yet know what attributes are in common across all 18xx games (though
  I can make educated guesses), so these basics may not map to the game you are thinking
  about playing.  Players play the roles of investors in companies.  If you have a
  controlling interest in a company, then you get to control it.  Duh. Controlling
  a company generally means choosing how it expands, how it delivers goods, and how
  it handles profits. Profits can be distributed to shareholders (more dividends translates
  to appreciation of stock price) or retained for company operations.  Maybe the company
  needs to buy a new train… Players periodically get the opportunity to use their
  personal cash to buy or sell stock. If you have the most money at the end of the
  game, you win. The operations of the game felt like Age of Steam or Railroad Tycoon
  to me.  The business aspects felt like Acquire or Indonesia.  I love the blend and
  could easily see how the decisions I made as an individual and as a business owner
  would affect the outcome.  I made a few mistakes but must have done OK as I ended
  up in a virtual dead-heat with Tim.  Our scores were well within a rounding error
  of tolerance for this game (a fraction of a percent).  I had a blast and can’t wait
  to play again. I ordered 1850 because it centers on the midwest area where I grew
  up, and includes the town of Burlington, IA.  That happens to be the hometown of
  my parents and I’m taking my family there this weekend for memorial services for
  my two grandmothers who passed away earlier this year. As a final note, Jacob and
  I took another run at Axis & Allies: D-Day.  Jacob and I played while Julie and
  Matthew were away and I gave him a choice.  This one hasn’t seen much play since
  we got into Memoir ‘44, and I’m glad we brought it out again.  We played with the
  special tactics / event cards, and I’m not sure if they add much to the game other
  than more randomness and fiddliness.  Jacob enjoyed them though and he thoroughly
  spanked me as the Germans.  I had horrendous dice rolls early on which sealed my
  fate. '
