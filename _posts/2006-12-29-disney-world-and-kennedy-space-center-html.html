excerpt: 'Here''s a quick wrap-up on our trip to Florida last week.  After our visit
  to Homasassa Springs, we drove down near Disney World to stay in a timeshare for
  two nights to make the travel back and forth to the Kingdom a  bit easier.  Tuesday
  night we stopped in at Downtown Disney and had some great (if a bit overpriced)
  Irish food at the pub there.  Wednesday was Magic Kingdom day for just the four
  of us.  My parents rested and did some shopping.  It was as crowded as I''ve seen
  it and by the mid afternoon congestion was getting to be quite annoying.  We took
  advantage of the fast-pass system throughout the day and never waited in line for
  more than about 45 minutes.  Lowlight: waiting in line for Pirates of the Caribbean
  for 25 minutes only to have it shut down when we were less than 5 minutes from boarding. 
  Highlights: Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Carousel of Progress (aka the Carousel
  of Missed Opportunities). On Thursday we drove to Melbourne to check in with my
  Old Uncle Larry then shot up the Atlantic coast to visit the Kennedy Space Center.  The
  line to get on the bus at the space center was longer than any we waited in at Disney
  - how annoying!  The trip was very enjoyable if a bit rushed - we didn''t arrive
  at the center until well after noon.  Unfortunately we ran out of time on the bus
  tour and never got to stop at the International Space Station exhibit.  We also
  allowed way too little time to visit the Astronaut Hall of Fame at the end of the
  day. On Friday Larry and I played golf, we spent some time at the beach, then celebrated
  Christmas with a small gift exchange and a delicious meal.  Saturday found us flying
  back to Portland via Denver (post blizzard) with about a 3 hour delay in Denver. '
