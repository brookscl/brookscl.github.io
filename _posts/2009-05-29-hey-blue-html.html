excerpt: " Jacob got trained up and has started umpiring baseball games. Work has
  been slow so he's done some free games for the youth recreational league here in
  Sherwood. He has his first real (paid!) gig next Wednesday. The training was fairly
  limited - read the national high school rules book and attend a single training
  day, but his years of playing have given him a solid grounding in the rules.  I
  can't think of a better job for a young man like Jacob - it requires leadership,
  technical proficiency, physical fitness, and respect for both youth and adults.
  Oh, and standing tall in the midst of abrasive conflict!"
