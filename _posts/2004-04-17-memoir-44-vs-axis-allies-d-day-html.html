excerpt: 'George asked this question:  So how does this coincide with Hasbro''s Axis&Allies
  D-Day release?  I believe they will both be released about the same time - in June
  to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landing.  I think the games will
  be quite different though.  I was fortunate enough to playtest A&A D-Day (strategy
  articles available), and I think it is quite good.  It is very similar to the large-scale
  A&A but simpler - smaller scale, no economy, and less playing time.  But the basic
  ideas are similar (movement, combat system).  And it is just D-Day. Looking at Memoir
  44, you will see a more generic game system with a variety of scenarios (ala Battle
  Cry).  So you''ll have less geographic detail, the scale will be smaller, but you''ll
  get more flexibility. '
