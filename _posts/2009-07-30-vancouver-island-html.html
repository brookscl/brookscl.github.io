excerpt: 'For over a year Julie and I discussed various ideas for a special trip to
  celebrate her 40th birthday (coming up in early August). Our original plan was Italy
  but in the end we decided on something closer to home. Or rather I decided on something
  closer to home as I planned this trip as a semi-surprise for her, dropping various
  hints along the way. The San Juan Islands seemed like a great choice, but when my
  parents offered to give us some timeshare points I used that to narrow my search
  and found a great property on Vancouver Island (Pacific Shores). You can find more
  photos from our adventure in my Flickr photo set. We drove up the Olympic Peninsula
  and stopped at a few sites along the way, including a nice beach walk at low tide
  to see the clam and oyster harvesters on the Hood Canal. Also observed were dozens
  of beautiful bald eagles.  We spent much of our time hiking the areas around Nanaimo
  and Nanoose Bay. One of our favorites was the hike to Englishman River Falls.  Julie
  and I spent a day kayaking off Cedar-by-the-sea with our guide Kim from Wild Heart
  Adventures.  Our hotel / condo / timeshare way exceeded our expectations, and we
  found ourselves dining in most nights. This meant picking up fresh fish or steaks
  from a local grocer, veggies, wine, etc., then strolling out to the point on the
  bay to cook outdoors and enjoy the sunset. This also led to some great conversations
  with other visitors.  I think Julie would agree that our favorite day was the 5-6
  mile hike around Newcastle Island off Nanaimo. This is provincial park with no residences
  and some great hiking trails. We timed the visit so that we could walk across to
  Protection Island and have a beer at the Dinghy Dock pub before taking a ferry back
  to the mainland. '
