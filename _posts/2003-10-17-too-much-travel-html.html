excerpt: " This has been the lowest volume of posting I've had in a while - sorry
  for those of you who check here frequently for gaming-related posts.  I've been
  on the road way too much lately, and things will not be letting up for another month
  or so.  I do have a backlog of things to talk about, including:    Jacob celebrated
  his 9th birthday last weekend, and I've got some pics from the party  The Cubs. 
  On second thought, I don't want to talk about it.  The fantastic work Mikael Sheikh
  has been doing on his Wallenstein implementation, which he should be making publicly
  available before too long.  More Chess teaching information.  Classes start next
  week.   "
