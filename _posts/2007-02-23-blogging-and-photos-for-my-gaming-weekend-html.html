excerpt: I'm hosting a great crowd of friends out at our beach house at Salishan this
  weekend.  We are all quite chilly hear at the house waiting for the gas to be turned
  back on after the disaster yesterday.  Hopefully we'll be able to cook tonight.
  Meanwhile...  Mike is blogging the weekend. I'll post photos periodically to this
  Flickr set.
