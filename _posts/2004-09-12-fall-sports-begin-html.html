excerpt: 'Not only was this the opening weekend for the NFL (my Colts and Cowboys
  appear to be off to a stellar start.  At least the Seahawks won...), but Jacob and
  Matthew also began their football and soccer seasons.  Jacob continued his lifetime
  unbeaten football streak with a dominating win over Gladstone, while Matthew had
  a fun jamboree-style soccer game and had a pretty good showing.         Jacob once
  again is playing center on the first team.  Here he is working on snap practice
  before the game.  Jacob had his best game ever defensively, including a running-back
  sack about 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage.         Matthew having some fun
  kicking around before his game.  '
