</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I&#8217;m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I read <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hermann-hesse/siddhartha/gunther-olesch_anke-dreher_amy-coulter_stefan-langer_semyon-chaichenets">Siddhartha</a> and even submitted some typo corrections that I found. Good read but not life altering.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/12/Hermann-hesse-Wanderer-Shadow-Gunnar-Decker-review">How Hermann Hesse became a hero of the Sixties counterculture</a> &#8211; Learn more about the impact Hesse had in the 60s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read some of <a href="https://amzn.to/2CaJk1T">The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist</a> but bailed about halfway through. I love his &#8220;real&#8221; books but this transcription of a talk he gave was boring and bland.</li>
<li>Read one of the best sci-fi books I&#8217;ve encountered over the last five years, <a href="https://amzn.to/2CdKYQd">The Fifth Season (The Broken Earth, #1)</a>.</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://amzn.to/2VGFQgC">Uprooted</a> for some solid standalone fantasy.</li>
<li>Jacob gifted me <a href="https://amzn.to/2RmISIo">Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock</a> for my birthday and it was a fun read. A bit disjointed at times as it is a collection of essays that don&#8217;t always hang together.</li>
<li>I mostly read the new edition of <a href="https://amzn.to/2D2eiuW">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a>, primarily the front matter and a few of the revised refactorings. I&#8217;m planning to apply some of these to a side project I&#8217;ve been working on to see how it hangs.</li>
<li>I read most of <a href="https://amzn.to/2D0VjRc">WTF?: What&#8217;s the Future and Why It&#8217;s Up to Us</a> but could have done without it. Too much like a Wired article, and destined to be the opposite of evergreen in my opinion.</li>
<li>Scanned through <a href="https://amzn.to/2RJqOYc">Wicked Cool Shell Scripts: 101 Scripts for Linux, OS X, and Unix Systems</a>. Like the Refactoring book, no point in going through page by page but was helpful to scan it for ideas and mental notes for future use. Includes a nice library of utility scripts worth using.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I&#8217;m Playing</h2>
<p>Lots of games played over the winter holiday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32521360">Dead of Winter</a> several times and while it was fun it won&#8217;t stay in my collection. I&#8217;m not a big fan of cooperative games with hidden agendas.</li>
<li>Played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32558688">18Lilliput</a> and probably messed up the rules, violating the certificate limit. Will try again soon.</li>
<li>The party game hit was <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32580845">Just One</a> and we played it close to 10 times over the holday. Great cooperative party game.</li>
<li>I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32605893">Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles on 2018&#8211;12&#8211;18</a> once and then taught / mentored two other games over the holiday. My favorite easy entry into the tactical wargaming world.</li>
<li>Played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32619865">7 Wonders</a> for the first time in a while. Julie and Dave stomped us.</li>
<li>Did a quick stand-up game of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32631775">Can&#8217;t Stop</a>. Always a hoot.</li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32647399">Tiny Epic Galaxies</a> was in the game collection at the house we stayed in over the break so Jacob, David and I gave it a try. Solid game, maybe the best I&#8217;ve seen in the &#8220;Tiny&#8221; series.</li>
<li>We had a big game of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32669434">The Great Dalmuti</a>. Always goes over well.</li>
<li>I played the evil alien in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32670731">Not Alone</a>. Solid game.</li>
<li>We broke out <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32708321">Charterstone</a> and got most of the original players back together to play episodes 9 and 10 (so two left I think). Enjoying it but won&#8217;t be my favorite worker placement game.</li>
<li>Nephew Geoff got <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32787694">Azul</a> for Christmas so I taught him how to play.</li>
<li>Dave really enjoys <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32800708">Codenames</a> so we played that several times.</li>
<li>Geoff gave me <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32829071">Captain Sonar</a> for my birthday and we played several times. I&#8217;m awful at it, but it is an engaging if stressful real-time team vs. team game.</li>
<li>Matthew loves <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32896842">Pax Renaissance</a> so we played several times. So much game inside this tiny box. Finally played the expansion.</li>
<li>During college bowl games Matthew and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32924856">Innovation</a>. I prefer the base game, low player count.</li>
<li>Julie and I played our last unopened Timeline game, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/33112754">Timeline: Events</a>. I like this series.</li>
</ul>
