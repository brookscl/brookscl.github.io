excerpt: 'Jacob won the Sherwood middle school chess spelling tournament earlier this
  year and was given the chance to compete at the county (actually Northwest Oregon)
  level and he won. This will be his second trip to the state contest, which will
  be held Labor Day weekend at the state fair. Congrats Jacob! '
