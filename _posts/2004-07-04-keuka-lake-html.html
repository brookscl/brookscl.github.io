excerpt: " Greetings from Keuka Lake, NY!  We took the red-eye from Portland last
  Thursday night, arriving at the lake cottage around 11am on Friday morning.  The
  weather has been very decent so far, though as of now (Sunday evening July 4) we
  are in the midst of a thunderstorm watch.  This could put a damper on our plans
  to take the boat up to Branchport to watch the annual fireworks show from the lake.
  \        The older, or “yellow” cottage.  We have two cottages adjacent to each
  other on the west side of Keuka Lake in western NY.  Our cottage is just about adjacent
  to the bluff in where the “Y” portion of the lake begins. Our time at the lake is
  usually divided by a set of activities that is frequently weather-condition determined. 
  When the winds are blowing up, that means sailing and tubing (white caps mean lots
  of bouncing!).  When it gets calm, particularly during mid-week when there's less
  traffic, that means water skiing.  And when the rains come, we usually hang out
  inside the cottage and head up the road for a gully hike to enjoy the increased
  water flow.         Jacob sailing the Sunfish. On a July 4 weekend, there's usually
  too much boat traffic to water-ski so we hoped for some winds today.  The weather
  cooperated - in fact, there's a major low-pressure front coming in that created
  some outstanding southeasterly winds this afternoon, allowing all of us to spend
  some quality time in the Sunfish.  Things are blowing up a bit too much to do a
  checkout right in the Flying Dutchman, so we'll wait for a quieter day before venturing
  out in the larger, older boat.         Matthew raising the “gauntlet of rock” while
  tubing. Tomorrow Jerry and I will head over to Seneca Lake for some golf at the
  course on the west side of the lake.  This is an affordable quality public course
  that I've enjoyed playing for the past 10 years.         Jacob sailing with grandpa
  Jerry.  The winds were fantastic!"
