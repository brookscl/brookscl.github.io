excerpt: Jacob and I were eager to play Roads and Boats again, so persuaded Matthew
  to join us for a Sunday afternoon game. I was a bit hesitant, not knowing if Matthew
  would latch onto a game that can be a bit of a brain burner and would hardly be
  considered light. Given he enjoyed War of the Ring, I should not have been surprised
  with his pleasure playing this. Jacob is very much a natural at planning ahead on
  both logistics and production. He once again mostly ignored the wonder and focused
  on working towards coins and stock certificates. I was more aggressive in updating
  my transporters, getting to 5 wagons fairly quickly followed by a couple of rowboats.
  Matthew went long on the wonder, earning points in just about every row while learning
  his way around the production tree. Matthew and I were fairly convinced that Jacob
  would be the runaway victor (again), but I researched specialized mines and new
  mine shafts (after building a "normal" mine so that I could grab some ore) and got
  a nice steady flow of gold. Jacob worked his way to a stock certificate and would
  have had a second soon, but Matthew forced the game to end by racing the wonder.
  I had a nice mix of wonder points, raw gold, and two coins and edged out a narrow
  victory (204 to 186). Matthew loved the game and this might become a staple in the
  house.
