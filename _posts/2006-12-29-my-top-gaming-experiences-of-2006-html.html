excerpt: 'Maybe I''ll do a top n games list for 2006 at some point, but when I reflect
  on the past year what comes to mind are great gaming experiences, not great games.
  New Years Magic: the Gathering Tournament Magic doesn''t get played very often in
  my house, but when we do it is always a blast.  We are heading into our fourth year
  running of a Magic sealed deck tournament, and I''m excited as ever to do it over
  the coming weekend.  Sealed deck tournaments (and booster drafts) get to the core
  of what Magic is all about: discovering new cards and combos, creative deck building,
  and strong tactical play. Conquest of the Empire This was my favorite big conquest-type
  game of the year (we played with the Martin Wallace rules).  I found this to be
  a huge improvement over Struggle of Empires, mostly because of streamlined play
  and nicer bits.  Everyone was in the game and we found it very engaging through
  the end.  I also love a game that easily plays all of the Rude/Brooks boys in a
  balanced fashion. 18FL / 1850 I''m at risk of turning into an 18XX geek.  Playing
  18FL at Eric''s was easily one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I''ve had
  recently - I love the pure economics, the no-luck, and the dialog we all have as
  we compete/cooperate.  I mentioned during our play of 1850 two nights ago how nice
  it is to play with other unwashed newbies as I find the open discussion and lack
  of cut-throat play more enjoyable than it might be with a different crowd.  I don''t
  expect to start collecting these games (I only own 1850 now, and I can leave the
  collecting up to Eric and Tim), but I hope to play at least 3-4 times in 2007. Roads
  & Boats I''m glad I picked this one up, and it will be hard to justify bringing
  out Antiquity or Indonesia over this title when choosing a big Splotter game to
  play.  I enjoy the combination of logistics and economics in the game and find it
  much less punishing than Antiquity - even though I lost miserably at R&B, I never
  felt like I wasn''t moving forward. Liar''s Dice Jacob''s Boy Scout troop held a
  game night on Dec 15 - mostly console video games, but I made sure to bring a few
  board games.  We played some Incan Gold but the huge hit was Liar''s Dice.  It was
  great seeing some of the older scouts sitting down with adults and playing this
  game.  The last game we played ended with a showdown between one of the other adult
  leaders and me - he with 5 dice, and me with just 1.  Through a combination of lucky
  dice rolls and good bluffing I managed a win, something I thought was near impossible.
  Oh, can I mention Guitar Hero 2??  I know it isn''t a board game, but this is just
  about the coolest electronic game of any kind I''ve ever played.  I''m quickly turning
  into a console gaming convert (from PC gaming) after spending some time playing
  this and Madden NFL.'
