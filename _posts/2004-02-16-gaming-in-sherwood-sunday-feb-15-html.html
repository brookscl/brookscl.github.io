excerpt: 'We welcomed a small crowd into our home again this weekend for some gaming
  on Sunday.  Gameplay lasted from about noon until 8:30pm, and we were fortunate
  to once again host David Chapelle from Atlanta. Checkers 2000 George was nice enough
  to bring by his copy of Checkers 2000, an interesting checkers variant that Julie
  and Matthew tried while the rest of us played Domaine.  Feedback was favorable on
  this game, and George is letting us borrow it for a while so I can play with each
  of the boys.  Matthew beat Julie, with the fatal blow being a late game triple jump.        Julie
  and Matthew try out Checkers 2000. Domaine DavidE, George, Jacob, and I quickly
  jumped into a game of Domaine.  This was the first four-player game for me (I think
  any of us), and while George was familiar with Lowenherz (Domaine''s ancestor) he
  had not yet tried Domaine.  So David and I quickly explained the rules while we
  setup and we launched into the game.        Jacob, George, and David contemplate
  the early game positions.  Jacob (white) was quick to grab a valuable middle board
  spot with three different mines.  I (orange) had the luxury of a corner to myself.
  Play proceeded quickly - we finished the game in about exactly an hour.  George
  was a bit too slow in getting his first domain (and therefore any income source),
  and Jacob was immediately put into a defensive position with his valuable domain
  which caused him to neglect his other castles.  So it was mostly a raise between
  David and me.  As the game drew to an end, David pulled ahead with some strong expansions
  into my territory (pulling me down and pushing him up).  He got too far ahead for
  me to catch him though it was a fairly close finish. Royal Turf As the others arrived,
  KC put together a game of Royal Turf, joined by Chuck, Matthew, Julie, Mike, and
  DavidC.  Julie was the big winner.        KC teaches the crowd Royal Turf, the game
  of horserace betting. Coloretto DavidE, Jacob, DavidC, and Mike played Coloretto.
  I''m fairly certain DavidE won (since he has something like a 15 game winning streak
  in multi-player games!).  His feedback on the game itself isn''t too favorable though:  I
  think there are other quick & light fillers that are more intellectually rewarding:
  Zircus Floheati (or whatever it''s called); Money; Loco!; Katzenjammer Blues. Oh
  yeah, those are all by Knizia... Still, if others wanted to play this while waiting
  for other gamers to arrive, I wouldn''t outright protest.        The light cardgame
  Coloretto comes out. Attika DavidE, DavidC, and Mike then squared off for a game
  of Attika.  This is one of my favorite newer games so I''m sorry I missed out on
  this one.  From what I saw, the game ended pretty quickly with a temple-to-temple
  victory.  It will be interesting to see how this game changes as players get more
  experienced in blocking this sort of victory.        Attika! New Eden 2 DavidE requested
  to play another game of New Eden 2, the wonderful new prototype from KC Humphrey. 
  I''m sure KC loves hearing someone ask for his game by name, but he deserves the
  recognition for the good work he is doing.        DavidE places his tile in New
  Eden 2. Princes of the Renaissance A few folks were interested in trying out this
  Martin Wallace game, and since I had played once I offered to teach it.  Chuck had
  also played this once. In this case, we had a serious problem with a runaway leader
  (George).  George accumulated a combination of tiles that gave him a 3-point discount
  when bidding on the condotierrie role.  This meant that he was able to fight in
  nearly every battle, often winning because of his troop strength.  He accumulated
  6 (!) laurels by the end of the game, netting him an extra 20 victory points.  This
  was more than enough to secure his victory - a well played game by George.  I suspect
  if the rest of us had been a bit more alert we could have prevented it, but by the
  end of the 1st age most of us were predicting him as the winner.        KC, Chuck,
  and George play Princes of the Renaissance. El Grande I was disappointed to miss
  this game, but I offered to teach Volldampf instead (I love that game too).  Apparently,
  via some skillful negotiation, DavidE was able to pull out the victory.        Jacob,
  Mike, KC, DavidC, and DavidE play El Grande. Volldampf I taught George, Julie, Matthew,
  and Chuck the train transportation game of Volldampf, another Martin Wallace classic. 
  This game is similar in many ways to its descendent Age of Steam, but offers simpler
  mechanics and shorter gameplay. Matthew had a challenging time understanding the
  mechanics - this is probably too much game for him.  It also made him very susceptible
  to coaching, and since he took such a liking to Chuck he started working to find
  routes that benefitted Chuck as well as himself.        George, Julie, Matthew,
  Chuck, and I play Volldampf. With five players, each player will place a maximum
  of only 8 tracks, and during each turn only two can be placed.  I''m not wild about
  the game with this many people - the two-track limitation slows down income production
  and reduces the number of options. I was way behind for the first few turns, but
  staged a strong comeback.  My debt situation prevented me from being a serious contender
  though, and Julie pulled out a 1 point victory over Chuck. Crokinole We pulled out
  our $10 Amazon special crokinole board for some finger-flicking fun.        Chuck,
  Chris, Matthew, and George battle in Crokinole. Vector Prime Jacob taught George
  and DavidE his Star Wars themed prototype named Vector Prime.  This game is similar
  to Star Wars: Epic Duels, with some card and dice-driven combat.  Jacob hand-made
  the components and is a great first attempt for him.  I appreciate the attention
  David and George gave to his game, including some valuable feedback.        Jacob
  teaches his hand-made prototype Vector Prime. Ark of the Covenant We had a hard
  time settling on a game to play, and a couple of folks wanted to see Ark of the
  Covenant, the Inspiration Games release in the Carcassonne family.  This is just
  Carcassonne with a few twists thrown in, not unlike the various expansions released
  over the past few years.  Carcassonne is a great game with 2-3 players, but with
  5 there is way too much downtime and chaos for my liking.  Oh, and DavidE won (again!)
  with me about 5 points behind in second place.        Five-player Carcassonne (I
  mean Ark of the Covenant).  Ouch! Titan: the Arena I asked to play this game, having
  heard so much praise and knowing that there is a re-release coming from Fantasy
  Flight Games.  These guys were obviously pros, but were fairly kind during this
  learning game.  This is a very enjoyable game and I look forward to seeing the new
  release.         David and George evaluate their bets in Titan: the Arena. Pizzza
  The evening ended with KC teaching my family another of his recent prototypes. 
  Pizzza (I hope I included the correct number of Zs) is an easy to learn family game
  with simple mechanics.  Everybody enjoyed it - Matthew even gave it a ''9''!  There
  is a tile laying and connection mechanic similar to New Eden 2.  My only suggestion
  is to improve the artwork a bit to make it easier to distinguish the different ingredients,
  and to make scoring markers that better align with the ingredients.  Another winner
  from KC!        Julie contemplates where to add to the pizza.'
