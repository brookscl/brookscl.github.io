<p>Played a just-released cooperative party game last night called <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640/just-one">Just One</a>. It is in the "more of an activity than a game category" but everyone had a blast. There are some house rules that you'll need to decide on to make this game work for you. I think we were a bit too lax at times. Reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames">Codenames</a> in terms of how non-verbal clues or qualifiers can steer the game.</p>
