excerpt: 'Quick session report this time - I''m in Sun River with the RipCity group
  and got a bit behind.  Gotta catch up so that I can start posting photos from the
  weekend! Last Sunday morning, before the finale of Jacob''s tournament, he and I
  sat down to play a couple of new games for us: O Zoo Le Mio and Alexandros. O Zoo
  Le Mio came out first and was our favorite.  A fairly light game, it is reminscent
  of Carcassonne and other tile laying games.  Players are in charge of building out
  their own zoo by laying tiles and trying to make attractive exhibits to steal visitors
  away from opponents.         Jacob examining his zoo. Exhibits become attractive
  by having adjacency with others of the same type.  This isn''t always easy because
  of tile placement rules.  When your attraction has the most stars, you attract two
  visitors.  Second place attracts a single visitor.  These visitors, along with adornments
  like park benches (created when you enclose an area with a path) and trees (awarded
  to the players with the most and second-most shrubs), score points at the end of
  five separate scoring rounds.         Beautiful bits in this game. Jacob got off
  to a strong start, but by the final rounds I was ahead.  Given that each round successively
  scores a multiplier (first round 1x, second 2x, etc.), I finished pretty far ahead. 
  This game was a blast and would probably be even better with three or four players.
  Alexandros, on the other hand, will take a few more plays for me to decide if it
  is a keeper (I got both of these games for 50% off so I figured it was worth the
  risk).  Jacob and I both found it a bit dry and abstract.  Players try to wall off
  and control regions delimitted by Alexander''s wanderings.  The bits are certainly
  nice enough, especially for a small-box game.  '
