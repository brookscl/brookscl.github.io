excerpt: 'If you know me or read this site very often, then you know that I travel
  quite a bit.  So much so that I have a hard time using all of my frequent flier
  miles, particularly those I accumulate on airlines I use less like Delta and Alaska. 
  Operation Hero Miles is a great way to support our troops with almost no bureaucracy
  standing in the way.  Here''s some information from their website:  In September
  2003, the Pentagon started giving soldiers stationed in Iraq two-week leaves in
  the largest R & R program since the Vietnam War. Soldiers on R & R or Emergency
  Leave are flown by the military to Germany or three airports in the United States,
  Baltimore/Washington, (BWI), Dallas/FortWorth, (DFW), or Atlanta, (ATL ) for free.
  The soldiers have been responsible for flights the rest of the way in the U.S. to
  their destinations, until Congress provided funding for this purpose on November
  3, 2003. However, this funding is not yet available and may not be sufficient for
  all the troops or troops on "Emergency Leave". More than 470 soldiers a day are
  arriving in the U.S. Many soldiers on R&R leave must purchase high-priced last minute
  airfares to connect to their hometowns once their military flights land at the airports
  in Baltimore, Dallas or Atlanta. Soldiers on "Emergency Leave" must still pay the
  full cost of their domestic travel when they are rushed home for the family death,
  birth, illness or other emergency. The military does not pay the cost of their travel
  in the United States, so your frequent flyer miles are a huge help. Americans have
  donated their unused frequent flyer miles to the Department of Defense to help troops
  travel home and spend quality time with their loved ones, without worrying about
  how much it will cost. I just found a place to use my Alaska and Delta miles!'
