excerpt: ' A few folks have emailed me and congratulated me on my semi-retirement.  I''m
  very grateful for the remarks and support, but I do feel the need to make a clarification.  Technically
  I view myself in a mini-retirement right now.  What''s the difference?  Both of
  them are constrained in a dimension: mini-retirement is constrained in duration
  (meaning that it will end at some point), while a semi-retirement is constrained
  in money or hours worked per week or weeks per year.  So during my mini-retirement,
  I''m not working at all.  But it must stop at some point.  Now, if I could only
  find a job or role that would then allow me to be semi-retired, then I would be
  set.   Remember that post I made on debt-free living?  I understand that the math
  of paying off a mortgage may not always make sense, but the psychology of it sure
  feels pretty good right now.   What might be next for me?  Figuring that out is
  one of the goals I have for the next 2-3 months.  I''m talking to a lot of different
  people and the spectrum of choices is huge right now.  Here''s a short list of some
  of the ideas popping around:       Find another CTO-like job at a local software
  company  Be a consultant to start-ups or potential investors in start-ups   Start
  my own software or software-as-a-service company     Become a high school computer
  science teacher  Become a professional photographer.  I realize you don''t just
  suddenly "become" one of these, but I''m working along a path to at least have this
  as a part-time vocation.  Be a trainer on software development process, presentation
  skills, etc.    Be a freelance Ruby on Rails developer     Be a college instructor
  or professor   Clearly I have some work to do.  Comments or emails to scare me away
  from any of these options are encouraged.'
