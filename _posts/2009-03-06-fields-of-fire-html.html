excerpt: 'I''m obsessed with Fields of Fire, and I''ve only played 1/5 of a full scenario.
  When I say obsessed, I mean I keep thinking about how much I want to play this game.
  Finding the time to play it is another matter... Adding to the obsession was the
  past week re-watching the Band of Brothers series with the family. That was my fourth
  or fifth time through the series and it never gets old. Did you know that The Pacific
  is due out later this year? After two failed starts trying to learn the game on
  my own, I coaxed Doug into a visit to teach a few of us how to play. Mike and Jesse
  joined me to learn the game with two concurrent solitaire sessions. Doug did a great
  detailed write-up on the teaching session, and you should also check out his 3-part
  series in ramping up with the game:    Components    Preparation    Sequence of
  Play Allow me to walk you through some photos and some of the basics of the game.
  The initial setup or a scenario is randomized primarily through the map configuration,
  which consists of a 2D array of terrain cards. In the initial WWII scenario you
  have three platoons (along with company-level assets) charged with taking primary
  and secondary objectives. You choose the objectives based on the scenario guidelines.   The
  game sequence is complex, and made no easier due to the much maligned ruleset for
  the game. Read Doug''s overviews if you want to go deeper, but I''ll provide a brief
  abstract here:    This is a command-point driven game, where the most effective
  use of commands are those handed down from on high. This is generally randomized
  through card draw.    Units and lower-ranking leaders can often act of their own
  initiative.    Lines of communication are key to make effective use of your command
  structure.    Firing just happens, and effects result from the presence of fire.   I
  didn''t get far enough into the game to really grok smoke signals, pyrotechnics,
  and casualty collection. I did get far enough into it to see the elegance and creativity
  in this game. Kudos to the designer, and shame on the developer (and designer) for
  the poor rules - get this fixed! This is too good a game to be left on the shelf.  Thanks
  so much to Doug for helping a few of us get over the initial learning curve. I hope
  to bring this out to Salishan over spring break and get a few scenarios into it,
  maybe with Jacob''s help. '
