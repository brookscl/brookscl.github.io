<p>I will return to <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/bggcon">BGG.CON</a> this year, and I get to bring a friend this time! Yes, Julie will join me for the first time! This will be my ninth visit.  <a href="http://ginn5j.com">Of course Jim</a> will be joining, but sadly not Jill :-(. I screwed up my hotel reservation early on (booked the prior weekend) so we are staying a short walk away at the Grand Hyatt.</p>
<p>I looked over my backlog of games I've been wanting to play and cherry picked a few to propose to play at the convention this year. I'm usually not eager to play the new hotness from Essen so many of these are from past years.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66589/navegador">Navegador (2010)</a> -- I like most of the Mac Gerdts games and generally love the rondel mechanic. This was a big hit back at BGG.CON 2010.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59959/letters-whitechapel">Letters from Whitechapel (2011)</a> -- Looks like a great deduction / chase game and is very highly regarded even three years after publication.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104006/village">Village (2011)</a> -- Classic Euro worker placement.  Jim and I will have to be convinced to learn this vs. playing our classic BGG mainstay <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24480/pillars-earth">Pillars of the Earth</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119804/empire-express">Empire Express (2012)</a> -- I know Jim used to play a lot of crayon rail games and I've played twice.  It always seemed a bit long and tiresome, but I love the core mechanisms. I'd like to see if this express version hits the mark.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica">Terra Mystica (2012)</a> -- This game is ranked #2 on BGG and I still haven't tried it... don't think Jim has either. Gotta try it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136888/bruges">Bruges (2013)</a> -- I've played many of the Stefan Feld dice games and have enjoyed them all, so looking forward to trying this release from last year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144733/russian-railroads">Russian Railroads (2013)</a> -- Several folks in my game group say this was the best release in 2013 and... I haven't played it yet. Worker placement with railroads, so I'm in.  Jim and I wanted to play last year but had a hard time finding an open table.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155426/castles-mad-king-ludwig">Castles of Mad King Ludwig (2014)</a> -- One of the new hot games that I want to try.  I think it might be in high demand in the hot games area so I suspect you'll see this on my list again next year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161970/alchemists">Alchemists (2014)</a> -- Ditto for this game. Might be in high demand.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157809/nations-dice-game">Nations: the Dice Game (2014)</a> -- Love Nations the board game, hoping I'll like the dice game.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161417/red7">Red7 (2014)</a> -- This is one of the Essen release card games that I think Julie will like.  Hopefully it will be in the library.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147431/cubist">CUBIST (2014)</a> -- This is an Essen release abstract game that has you building structures with dice that you roll first.  Looks like fun and very cool to look at.</li>
</ul>
