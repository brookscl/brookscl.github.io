excerpt: 'Mayfair Games issued a press release today announcing that Microsoft will
  publish an online version of Settlers of Catan as a premium game service at MSN
  Zone.  Overall I think this is a positive thing - more exposure means more publishers
  and potentially more (and better games).  I do worry about what this will do to
  some of the free online version such as Settlers 3D and BSW. Update: Matthew Baldwin
  just posted a screenshot.'
