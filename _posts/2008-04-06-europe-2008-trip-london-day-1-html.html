excerpt: " Time to start the steady flow of photo-journal posts for our Europe trip!
  I'll break this into a day-by-day journal and will include plenty of photos. If
  you are a (war)gamer, you'll probably enjoy my recap of the Ardennes the most. This
  is a trip we had been planning since late summer of 2007. It started as a trip for
  just the four of us, but at a family wedding in November we added Julie's brother
  David and his wife Lisa to the group. The exchange rate was poor in the fall, but
  we had no idea just how bad it would get by spring, particularly the Euro. Fortunately
  we paid up front for our two longest hotel stays, locking in our biggest expenses
  at about 1.35:1 which saved us about 15-20%. One goal for the trip was to have a
  healthy mix of big city and countryside, another was to get significant time in
  the Ardennes to explore Battle of the Bulge sites. London and Paris made perfect
  bracket cities for the Ardennes. We also wanted to travel as light as possibly,
  limiting luggage to carry-on backpacks to ensure mobility and align with our rapid-pace
  itinerary. We used a number of online resources to help as maximize effectiveness
  while minimizing space, including Travelite, Onebag, and Tim Ferriss. Let me give
  a quick refresher on the overall itinerary:    Wednesday, Mar 19 - depart from PDX
  and OKC    Thursday, Mar 20 - Sunday, Mar 23 - London    Sunday, Mar 23 - Eurostar
  train to Brussels, in-country train to Liege, drive to La Roche en Ardennes    Sunday,
  Mar 23 - Wed, Mar 26 - La Roche en Ardennes, Belgium    Wed, Mar 23 - Thu, Mar 24
  - Reims, France    Thursday, Mar 24 - Monday, Mar 31 - Paris, France    Monday,
  Mar 31 - return home   David and Lisa timed their arrival at Gatwick to be about
  the same as ours (they originated in Oklahoma City). We were supposed to arrive
  90 minutes after them on Thursday, March 20 but we made exceptional time and landed
  within 5 minutes of each other. Unfortunately our passport control line took 45
  minutes to get through, but we were still on the Gatwick Express train to Victoria
  by 9:30am and arrived in London by shortly after 10:00.  Our first step at Victoria
  was to buy London Underground passes for all of us. I wasted some time standing
  in line at the automated machines before I realized that I wouldn't be able to buy
  the kids' tickets there, so re-directed myself to the assisted line to take care
  of business. We purchased 3-day passes for the adults and 3 1-day passes for Jacob
  and Matthew. These passes turned out to be somewhat unreliable, with some of cards
  stopping to work early in the process. Wasn't a big deal as we just flashed them
  to an assistant at each entry/exit to gain passage. Next we walked to our hotel,
  the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury, and managed to check in early. The hotel was fantastic
  and a decent bargain, especially for us trying fit four people into one room. I
  would have preferred to stay in a B&B and get more local flavor, but there just
  aren't good options for a family of four as just about everywhere we looked would
  have forced us to get 2 rooms. Holiday Inn and Best Western were great choices for
  finding hotels - easy to use web sites, trustworthy quotes and booking, and in the
  end we were very happy with the quality.  I wanted to start the day with a city
  orientation including a city bus tour. We hopped on the Underground at Russell Square
  and went to Leicester Square to then walk to Trafalgar Square. The weather was interesting
  and surprisingly similar to Portland - windy, chilly (40s), with sporadic rainfall.
  As we walked to Trafalgar we stopped in the National Portrait Gallery and checked
  out the Tudor paintings among others. We should have just spent the next hour and
  toured the National Gallery, but instead got on a bus from Trafalgar to the Tower
  of London. Unfortunately the mid-day traffic was horrendous, even in the bus express
  lanes, dragging out the trip. While it was nice to be inside during the ensuing
  downpour, this only added to the disappointment as the inside windows became very
  fogged up. It was a good chance for Matthew, Dave, and I to catch up on some sleep
  though.  We aborted the bus tour at the Tower and got back on the Underground to
  head back to our home turf and visit the British Museum, which has changed significantly
  since my last visit in 1990. The interior covered courtyard is nothing short of
  amazing. We focused on the permanent exhibits, paying special attention to the ancient
  Egyption, Persian, and Greek antiquities. The boys held up reasonably well - it
  was very important for us to manage our time in the art and history museums to keep
  the boys engaged.  We left the museum by around 5 or 5:30pm - way ahead of my original
  schedule as I knew it would be open late that Thursday night and had hoped to work
  a bit later into the evening before we cut for dinner. Those of you that have traveled
  east-bound to Europe on a red-eye know how critical it is to stay up to a decent
  evening hour before retiring.  Our solution - spend plenty of time at two pubs and
  milk out another 2-3 hours eating pub food and sampling beers. We started at the
  Marquis of Cornwallis pub directly across the street from our hotel. The food was
  good enough and the beer exceptional. In hindsight I think the boys enjoyed London
  over Paris because of the pub scene - they are plentiful, laid back, don't mind
  if you just hang around and drink beer, and obviously very social.  Next up was
  Lord John Russell, a fine pub but a bit smaller and hence more crowded. We lasted
  there until about 8pm then walked back to the hotel to crash."
