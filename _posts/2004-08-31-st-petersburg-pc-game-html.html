excerpt: Thanks to Aaron Haag and his post over at BGG, I've just learned that there's
  a PC version of St. Petersburg available for download.Â  If you are an English speaker,
  be sure to download the English resource file and save it to the top level install
  directory for the application (not the Hilfe subdirectory).
