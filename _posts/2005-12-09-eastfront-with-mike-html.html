excerpt: "(or, how I could have saved a lot of lives had I been commanding the Germans
  on the east front). I had planned to do a session report on my game of Eastfront
  with Mike last week, but he did such a nice job reporting that I’ll just refer you
  there.  I did snap some photos which I’ll share here, along with a few annotations.
  We used Caylus blocks to demark the front line for the Summer ‘42 scenario.  Hah! 
  So many of you are still waiting to get your hands on this game and here we are
  already recycling parts for other uses.  Sorry, couldn’t resist.   I attacked broadly
  on all fronts, figuring that’s what the Germans should do.  I made a critical mistake
  however.  The first mistake was moving units outside of the command range resulting
  in unsupported combat.  I guess I assumed that if they were in command range pre-move
  that they would be in range for combat, which was a bit idiotic.   The result was
  some very unsuccessful unsupported combat and, even worse, a hole in my line allowing
  the Soviets to engage one of my precious HQ and cut off two major groups from supply. 
  I knew it was game over at this point but we continued to play.  My goal at this
  point was to explore as many of the mechanics as I could.   We ended up playing
  three months (out of a six month scenario) in about 4 hours.  By the end we were
  getting a full month completed in about 45 minutes.  Could probably get it down
  to 30 with effort and familiarity.    I’d like to play again, soon, while the mechanics
  and rules are fresh in my head."
