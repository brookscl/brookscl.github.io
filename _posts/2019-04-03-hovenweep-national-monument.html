<p>After two nights of hotel stays (we've learned that two nights is much better than one after finishing a backpacking trip), we made our way east to Colorado with a stop at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/hove/index.htm">Hovenweep National Monument</a>. This site is notable as it was a transition stopping point as the Puebloans abandoned the mesas and other regions in SE Utah in their migration south in the CE 1200s.</p>

<p>That didn't mean they built transition structures - clearly they meant to stay a while as these were the largest, most robustly built that we've seen so far. We love how they used the geography and built into the boulders and cliffs.</p>

<p>We are now camped in <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/colorado/canyons-of-the-ancients">Canyons of the Ancients</a> and will spend a few days exploring more sites and hiking in this area.</p>
