excerpt: I first noticed the projected release date of April 2006 for this collaboration
  in my latest issue of No Depression, then found this article giving more details. 
  “And Your Bird Can Sing”, “Cinnamon Girl”, and "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"? 
  You gotta be kidding me – if Amazon would let me pre-order this they would already
  have my money.
