<p>As I reinvigorate my blog I'm experimenting with improved workflows to easily publish from a variety of platforms. For example, the photo entries you see are a result of an iPhone workflow using Google Photos, the iOS Workflow app, and a single click to publish. I want this site to be a mix of longer writing and more ephemeral content like quick musings and photos.</p>
