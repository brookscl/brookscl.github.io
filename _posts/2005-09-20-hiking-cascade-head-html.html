excerpt: I’m a bit late in reporting this, but oh well.  It was a cool hike with some
  cool photos so better late than never.  We spent Labor Day weekend out at Salishan
  and Julie was anxious to get out and hike somewhere.  I suggested Cascade Head,
  having heard some great things about the scenic views from there.  The trailhead
  is just a few miles north of Lincoln City off of Hwy 101 (I’m listening to Highway
  61 Revisited right now… maybe I should switch to Jackson Browne?) so after about
  a 20 minute drive we were off on our adventure. Apparently the trailhead was moved
  a few years back to ease road congestion – park at Knight Park near the boat ramp
  and walk up the road from there.  The low parts of the trail wind through public
  land including national forest, but as you get near the head the trail is contained
  within Nature Conservancy land.  There are quite a few restrictions on land use
  in this area, so check ahead before attempting anything unusual (like backpacking
  / camping).  The early parts of the hike are within an old growth Sitka Spruce and
  Douglas Fir forest.  The trail is very well maintained here, with plenty of foot
  bridges and planking to get through the squishy areas.  Before long the trail opens
  to a meadow with the first glimpses of the coast stretching south from the head. 
  While this isn’t a terribly strenuous hike, pretty much the whole hike in is uphill
  and there are a few steep parts. As we were hiking through the meadow, Jacob spotted
  a slithery critter that I was able to pick up and play with for a while.  I love
  snakes.  We continued to climb, but it became clear that the boys were not going
  to be interested in making the final climb to the peak of Cascade Head.  Julie was
  kind enough to allow me the opportunity to finish the hike, so I high-tailed it
  up the top for some spectacular views of Lincoln City and beyond, including the
  Salishan spit. All in all, a great way to spend an afternoon and I highly recommend
  this hike if you find yourself on the beautiful Oregon coast.
