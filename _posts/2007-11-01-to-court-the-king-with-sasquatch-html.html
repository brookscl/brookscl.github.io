excerpt: 'Jacob invited a friend over for some Magic: the Gathering action.  After
  playing another prototype with Carey I joined in for some fun theme-deck action.  I
  then forced To Court the King on the both of them with the claim "It''s just like
  Magic, but with dice.  And there''s nothing to collect."   That was good enough
  for them (like I gave them a choice) and we got through most of a game before it
  was time to check out the candy loot from Matthew as he returned from begging.  There
  seems to be some depth to the game as the choices on how and when to use the characters
  are non-obvious.  Still, it seems very tactical which will be fine by me if we can
  play it consistently in 30 minutes.  Jacob and Bigfoot seemed to both like it. '
