excerpt: 'I''ve been travelling too much - only two days at home between trips this
  time.  I''m back on the road again, this time in New Orleans for our big annual
  conference: the BAI Retail Delivery show.  On Friday night I was able to engage
  the boys in a few games.  Jacob and I played the new Risk game: Lord of the Rings:
  Risk, Trilogy Edition, and Matthew and I played Balloon Cup.  On Saturday, Jacob,
  Matthew, Ken, and I ventured down to Corvallis to watch the Oregon State Beavers
  dominate the Stanford Cardinal in football.  Rarely have I seen such a one-sided
  event - it rained most of the game, but we were mostly oblivious given the dominance
  of OSU.  Lord of the Rings: Risk, Trilogy Edition  I haven''t played any of the
  prior Risk variants, so I have no basis for comparison.  I can say that this version
  is much better than the original game of Risk.    Yes, it is still a dice fest,
  but there are several reasons why I think this game is better:   Theme, theme, theme. 
  Just the simple addition of a map of Middle Earth and counters reflecting good and
  evil units make a huge difference.  Cards add an element of surprise.  Leaders add
  a strategic element to the game, since they can help you gain new cards while contributing
  to battles.  There is a countdown as the ring move towards Mordor, limiting the
  lengt of the game. /LI/UL Pimg src="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/content/binary/20031117LOTRisk2.JPG"
