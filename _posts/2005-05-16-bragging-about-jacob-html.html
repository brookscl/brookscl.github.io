excerpt: "</>  Anyone who reads this weblog knows that I'm just a little proud of
  my sons Jacob and Matthew.  Jacob recently participated in the Reader's Digest National
  Word Power Challenge at his school.  He did well enough in his school to advance
  to the state championship down in Salem last month.  The competition there was tough
  - 4th through 8th graders all grouped in together (Jacob is in the 4th grade) -
  and he didn't make it to the final round.  We found out the good news today though
  - on the written test he took to make it to the state championship, Jacob achieved
  the highest score of any 4th grader in the entire state.  Pretty cool."
