excerpt: 'I''m experimenting with a tool called Womcat, referred to me by my friend
  Greg.  This is a decent way to organize bookmarks, and I have provided some brief
  notes on each.  There are a few cool features about this tool, which is why I am
  trying it instead of just making my own HTML page of links:  It automatically provides
  an RSS feed to my bookmarks.  You can subscribe to this if you like and receive
  updates as I edit the list.  If you are bold enough to run Womcat yourself, you
  can aggregate my bookmarks into your own.  It has the ability to maintain what are
  called “weak subscriptions” - pages I don''t necessarily read, but are likely to
  contain links to interesting spots.  Womcat will check these weak subscriptions
  for me and tell me what outbound links they have in common.  Good way to find new
  content. Anyway, I''ve added it to my nav links on the right.'
