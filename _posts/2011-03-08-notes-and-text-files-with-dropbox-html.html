<p><a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2010/8/10/living-in-a-mac-world-3-years-later.html">A while back I wrote about my current Mac OS X ecosystem</a>. Part of this ecosystem has evolved quite a bit - I'm no longer using Notational Velocity or <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">SimpleNote</a>.  The main reason is that <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">DropBox</a> is the begin and the end of my synchronization needs - SimpleNote adds an unnecessary level of complexity to my world and at times would step on DropBox's toes and cause problems.</p>
<p>DropBox support has become ubiquitous on iPad applications.  The DropBox app itself is more than adequate for viewing text files, but I prefer to use the fantastic <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nebulous-notes-for-dropbox/id375006422?mt=8">Nebulous Notes</a> as it excels for both viewing and writing text files.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/5510643802/" title="DropBox for Text Files by brookscl, on Flickr"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/03/5510643802_cca13b1c78.jpg" alt="DropBox for Text Files" /></a></p>
<p>Nebbulous by default will attach itself to a particular DropBox folder which matches perfectly how I manage all my plaintext notes on my desktop with TextMate.  I can create and edit content on any of my devices and everything will stay in synch easily through DropBox.</p>
<p>There are several decent text editors available on the iPad with decent DropBox support - I've tried many of them.  I prefer Nebulous because of the text macro bar support which makes it dead simple for me to compose in <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a>.  The iPhone app is just as good.</p>
<p>Finally, on the Mac desktop I've become proficient enough with TextMate to obviate the need for a tool like Notational Velocity. If you don't have TextMate then certainly considering using this tool (but use the <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> fork, not the original).</p>
