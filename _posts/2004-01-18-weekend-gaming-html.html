excerpt: 'We had a fun weekend of gaming.  Julie and a friend made a date to go night
  skiing at Skibowl Friday night, so it was just the boys and me for some gaming fun. 
  Saturday evening, Ken and Brandon came over, with Brandon spending the night with
  Jacob and Matthew.  Sunday, while Jacob was at a baseball clinic, Matthew and I
  played a few two-player games. Crokinole My wonderful mother was kind enough to
  give me a $50 gift certificate at Amazon.  I have a huge backlog of books to read,
  so I immediately went to the Toys R Us section to see if there were any good deals
  on games.  I strongly encourage folks to periodically check out the Toys Outlet
  section - there are often very good deals to be found.  I recently mentioned the
  deal I found on Roller Coaster Tycoon, but I was also able to purchase a Crokinole
  board ($9.99 plus shipping) and the Attack! boardgame ($19.99). OK, so why did I
  purchase a $10 Crokinole board?  Sure, it is no substitute for a “real” solid wood
  board, but all we currently had was a beat up square Carom board.  I figured this
  would be a great, low-risk way to see if the family enjoys the game before forking
  over $200+ for a good board. This board is nice!  Sure, it isn''t nearly as friction-free
  as a good board, but it works great for the kids and it has come out every day this
  weekend.  I taught the boys how to play Friday evening and we had some fun 3-player
  matches.  I recommend this board highly if you want to give this dexterity game
  a try. Ricochet Robot I borrowed this game from a co-worker, so Jacob and Matthew
  wanted to give it a try before returning it.  This is a puzzle game with very little
  interaction - you can see what the puzzles are like at the online site.  I enjoy
  the game, but would be just as happy playing solo as I would with a group.  I''m
  glad a tried this before buying it, since I doubt it would come out much at our
  house.  We stopped after 5 rounds (the pizza showed up!). Attack! After having some
  pizza, Jacob, Matthew and I dove into a game of Attack!, a pseudo-WWII game.  I
  place this squarely between Risk and Axis and Allies in terms of complexity.        Jacob
  and Matthew setup their initial positions in Attack! One thing I like about this
  game (vs. Risk) is that it can be slower to develop, since the players (at least
  in the three-player game) can start to build up some buffer.  There are interesting
  choices every turn (moving, building, deploying a navy) and it was very easy for
  the kids to learn.  Unfortunately we didn''t get a chance to finish this game, but
  I think it will come back out soon. Crokinole On Saturday night when Ken and Brandon
  joined us around 4pm, we brought out Crokinole first.        Ken and Brandon get
  their first taste of Crokinole.  Ken and Matthew defeated the team of Brandon and
  Jacob. This was followed by a no-limit hold''em tournament that Ken won (the tourney
  finished with me heads up against Ken but with over a 4:1 chip lead, so I conceded).
  Liberty The kids went upstairs for some three-player computer action (mostly Age
  of Mythology, but a bit of Call of Duty as well), so Ken and I took advantage of
  the quiet to play a heavier two-player wargame called Liberty.  This is also a Columbia
  Games block game, and the more I play in this system the more I like it. Liberty
  is a wide-scale American revolutionary war game, where one player plays the part
  of the British (and American Indians) and the other plays the Americans (and friendly
  French).  I seem to recall that the Americans won this war, and the game may be
  tilted to produce this outcome as well.        Ken decides his next move in Liberty.
  This game is rough going for the British (similar to the position the Scots have
  in Hammer of the Scots) - they need to capture a good part of the eastern seaboard
  to win, and it can be extremely difficult to eliminate the opponent given the flexible
  retreat rules.  My strategy of running away from most of the fights unless I had
  a clear advantage worked well, and I was gradually able to eat away at Ken''s cities,
  nearly getting a decisive victory myself.  It became clear though (after 4+ hours
  of playing, but this was a learning game) that the game would most likely end in
  an American victory so we stopped early.  We both enjoyed it very much though and
  look forward to another play where we switch sides. Crokinole Matthew and I had
  a few hours together alone on Sunday, so we tried a two-player game of Crokinole
  to 200.  Matthew is improving rapidly, but I managed to beat him by about 50 points
  in this game. Magic: the Gathering Around New Years I picked up two starter decks
  for the Mirrodin Expansion, a cool set of cards centered around artifacts.  Using
  pre-constructed starter decks is a great way to continue to enjoy this wonderful
  game system without shelling out $100s to build competitive decks.  We played two
  hands, with the black-red deck winning both times (we traded decks between games.        Matthew
  examines his cards in Magic. Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers This has been sitting
  on my shelf for quite a while without a play, so we broke it out to see how it compares
  to the original.  This is a fun expansion (actually an entirely new game) that I
  highly recommend.  The scoring is much simpler and the artwork is beautiful.  Matthew
  claims that he likes this better than the original Carcassonne.        Matthew should
  be happy - he beat me by about 30 points in our first play of Hunters and Gatherers.'
