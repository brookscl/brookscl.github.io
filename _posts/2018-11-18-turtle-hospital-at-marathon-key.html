<p>Our first stop exploring the keys today is to the Turtle Hospital. Great mission and stories about their rescues and subsequent releases. A few permanent residents have lived here nearly 30 years. Theyâ€™ve released over 2,000 turtles back to the sea. Only 3 of the released have ever had to return.</p>
