<p>I surpassed my <a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2011/1/2/my-five-and-dime-for-2010.html">five and dime totals from 2010</a> and met my prediction that Thunderstone would make my nickel list in 2011.  Here is the breakdown:</p>
<h3>Dimes (games played 10 or more times)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-the-gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> -- thanks to a few tournaments I ran plus some long sessions with Matthew over winter break, I played Magic at least 30 times in 2011.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39953/a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game">A Game of Thrones: The Card Game</a> -- my new favorite collectible / living card game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nickels (games played 5 or more times)</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/18xx">18xx</a> -- In 2011 I played 1865 Sardinia (twice), 1846, 18AL, and Steam Over Holland.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders">7 Wonders</a> -- almost made my dime list with 9 plays.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59946/dungeons-dragons-castle-ravenloft-board-game">Castle Ravenloft</a> -- lots of play early in the year.  Looking forward to going through the Drizzt game with my family.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation">Innovation</a> -- first played at BGG.CON, this game saw many plays towards the end of the year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game">Lord of the Rings Card Game</a> -- great living card game that needs more play, especially now that I have enough expansion cards to do some deck building.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/53953/thunderstone">Thunderstone</a> -- Still enjoying this one, lately playing the Facebook app which is very well done.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I counted online games, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/69789/ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer">Ascension</a> would be on my dime list.  Sure to be on my nickel or dime list in 2012 is <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105134/risk-legacy">Risk Legacy</a>, my top game from 2011.  Hoping to continue my campaign with the boys this weekend.</p>
