excerpt: 'I picked up a few games over the past few weeks - some from the great online
  store Boards & Bits and some at the recent Game Storm.  Here''s a sampling:  Europe
  Engulfed - I am still a sucker for wargames, especially the lighter ones like the
  Columbia block series.  Europe Engulfed is a GMT game that essentially uses the
  same block system as the Columbia games.  This is grand-scale WWII action; reminiscent
  of Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, the classic Avalon Hill game I played frequently
  as a youth.  One key driver for the purchase was the set of favorable comments from
  Chris Farrell. Amun-Re - I don''t get to play this enough, I''ve enjoyed every play
  I have had, so I decided I should own it. Entdecker - I managed to get a good deal
  on this at Game Storm (about $25).  Supposedly a great exploration game by Teuber.
  Lost Cities - Jacob and I play frequently on BSW, so I want to own the real version.
  Princes of Florence - Classic game that I still haven''t played yet. Hase und Igel
  (Hare and Tortoise - here''s a picture of the version I own) - A classic racing
  game that I bought used from KC. Wildlife Adventure - Classic traveling / gathering
  game by Kramer.  Also bought used from KC. Loopin'' Louie - ''nuff said. This should
  keep us busy for a while.  It is taking tremendous self control to not purchase
  Schrille Stille after playing last Sunday, but so far I''m successfully resisting
  completing the checkout process at my favorite online store.'
