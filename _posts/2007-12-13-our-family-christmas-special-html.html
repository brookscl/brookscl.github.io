excerpt: 'This may rank as the dumbest, most inane video you watch this year so feel
  free to just move along.  Really, there''s nothing to see here. Still here?  Enjoy
  the show.  This was done over about a 1 hour period a few nights ago using GarageBand
  and some basic audio equipment.  Jacob did a nice job on electric guitar and I especially
  appreciate the hard work Gabbi put into her vocal performance.  That solid percussion
  section and backup vocal work you here is from none other than Julie and Matthew.   '
