excerpt: 'Time to play catchup.  Sorry, no photos in this post. Our lunchtime gaming
  group at Corillian is really picking up steam.  We are averaging about 8 per week
  and I wouldn''t be surprised if that number increases.  A week ago Friday, we split
  into two groups: 5 for Modern Art, 3 for Trias.  Unfortunately I had to teach both
  games (Eric was out) which made the start a bit slow and chaotic.  I helped jumpstart
  the Trias group then returned to teach and play Modern Art.  This was a first play
  of MA for me, other than a false start with my family last year.  We played the
  Mayfair reprint that I bought at GenCon last year. Wow, what a great experience. 
  This is considered to be one of the purest of the auction games (the only mechanic
  in the game is the auction).  There was a lot of joint analysis by the 5 newbies
  playing around the value of pieces coming up for auction - these are bright people
  I play with and they catch on quickly.  I could give a summary here, but I suggest
  you read this fantastic review by Fawkes over at the ''geek.  I do think we all
  have a lot to learn in this game and I suspect it will come out frequently at lunch. 
  This group is starting to request repeat performances, which will be refreshing
  as we hone our skills on a smaller number of games.  Final scores: Arron 371 Jason
  253 Tamara 448 David 441 Chris 523. Last weekend Jacob, Matthew, and I played a
  three-player scenario of HeroScape.  Matthew and I as the attackers (or, rather,
  rescuers of a hostage) took on Jacob as the defender.  This was a fun romp, with
  the attackers winning due to a tactical error made by Jacob near the end (I had
  to exploit it... does that make me a bad father??).  He had the stronger forces
  remaining, but failed to keep an adequate defense around the hostage, allowing me
  to sneak in.  Fortunately, the victory conditions didn''t require me to escape with
  the hostage - perhaps I was beamed up? - otherwise, I would have been disposed of
  quickly. Last Friday at work we brought out Colossal Arena again (San Juan was played
  at the other table).  This game is always enjoyable, and I think the newcomers enjoyed
  it.  San Juan was a big hit as well.  Might be time to bring out Puerto Rico at
  lunch... Finally, I thought I''d mention that Jacob and I are immersed in a game
  of Gettysburg: Badges of Courage.  This is a Columbia Games block game - my first
  glimpse was at Game Storm earlier this year.  Jacob just read Killer Angels, and
  I thought this would be a good way to tie some of the history into a light simulation. 
  He''s loving it so far and is starting to ask about some of the other block games
  I own - I suspect Wizard Kings will be coming out soon.'
