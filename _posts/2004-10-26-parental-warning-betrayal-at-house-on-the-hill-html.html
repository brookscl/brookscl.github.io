excerpt: 'While this game is a smash hit with the family, I should warn those of you
  contemplating playing this with younger children: consider toning down some of the
  narrative in the haunts.  A week after our playing, Matthew tolds Julie at night
  that he couldn''t stop thinking about the mummy that breathed into the girls mouth,
  whose eyes then turned red.  OK, now I''m freaking out myself.  '
