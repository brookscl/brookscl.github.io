excerpt: '  I''ve been using Backpack since the launch earlier this month.  I was
  initially attracted to Backpack because of the technology involved (Rails, AJAX),
  but I just became a paying customer because of the pure utility and simplicity of
  the service. We all have todo lists - once the list gets beyond 5-7 items, it is
  usually a good idea to write them all down.  I''ve used the task features in Outlook
  extensively; I even used Taskline for a while, a cool Outlook plugin that maps tasks
  into calendar entries.  My main issue with using Outlook tasks is that they aren''t
  as portable as I''d like them to be, even with synchronization to my BlackBerry. 
  Currently this synchronization only happens when docked, not wirelessly. I also
  have a long list of items I track across a range of projects, some work-related
  and some personal.  Many of my personal projects involve collaboration with others
  - often via emailed lists of assigned tasks.  So allow me to enumerate some of the
  very cool features of Backpack that I''m currently using:  Create pages for each
  of my projects.  On each page I can track a todo-list, notes, and (because I upgraded
  to the fee-based service) file/image uploads.  The data entry via AJAX is extremely
  slick.  There are a few kinks they still need to work out (especially around focus
  for editing list items). Share pages with the public or specific individuals.  For
  non-sensitive info, I just make a page public and share with my collaborators. 
  This allows them to view the page (read-only) without having to create a Backpack
  account.  Here''s an example page I''ve made public:   Access my Backpack from my
  mobile Blackberry browser via the mobile interface.  No AJAX support there of course,
  but the interface is clean enough and is well-designed for my most common use case:
  checking off task items. The killer feature, in my book: emailing items to my backpack.
  Each page has a unique, system-generated email address that can be used as a mailbox
  for adding content to a page.  I added these addresses to my contact list ("Backpack
  Personal", "Backpack Chess", etc.) and when I think of a new todo item, I email
  the appropriate Backpack with "Todo: Take care of FooBar" and seconds later it is
  added to my list. Use the reminder service to generate SMS reminder messages at
  specific times.  There are some great shortcuts for reminders as well. My recommendation:
  create a free test account and try it for a few weeks.  If you don''t spend much
  time at a computer, you may not find it as useful as I do.  But if you do, Backpack
  is a great way to keep your personal life in order.'

<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> since the launch earlier this month.  I was initially attracted to Backpack because of the technology involved (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>), but I just became a paying customer because of the pure utility and simplicity of the service.</p>
