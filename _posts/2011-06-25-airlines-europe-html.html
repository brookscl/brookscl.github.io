<p>I hosted my game group weekly session this week and got to play <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90419/airlines-europe">Airlines:Europe</a> with 5 players (Mike, JD, Greg, and Doug).  This is a remake of the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9/alan-r-moon">Alan Moon</a> classic game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/94/union-pacific">Union Pacific</a>, one of the better train games out there that scales well to five or six players.  UP was an update to a very early Alan Moon game called <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43/airlines">Airlines</a>. My friend Lorna did a <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/619218/comparisons-of-airlines-union-pacific-and-airlines">nice comparison of the three games</a>.</p>
<p>The game is streamlined from UP and we were able to play in well under 2 hours. I think I stumbled my way into a victory by virtue of playing the hand I was dealt with - no duplicate share cards.  This encouraged me to diversify and while at the end of the game I only had the leadership in one company, I had accumulated 2nd and 3rd place points from most of the others throughout the game.  I think JD and Doug were close 2nd/3rd place.</p>
<p>Fun game, nice components, but didn't feel like enough of an upgrade to me to consider replacing my copy of Union Pacific.</p>
