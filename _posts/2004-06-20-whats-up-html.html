excerpt: 'Wow - long time since I''ve posted anything too meaningful.  This post won''t
  break that trend.  It has been a busy few weeks, so very little has happened on
  the gaming front.  Work has been extremely busy - I manage to get home at a decent
  hour most days to see the boys'' baseball games (this coming week they play every
  evening M-F, and Jacob has tournaments both this weekend and next).  But most of
  my evenings tend to involve working again from 8pm until about midnight.  Here are
  a few things going on though:  Doug Walker and I are going to try a Cyberboard game
  of Europe Engulfed (gameset here). I still have not been able to play this game
  face-to-face, but I''m anxious to try it so this is probably the best way.  Doug,
  sorry I haven''t sent you my initial setup yet! Jacob, Matthew, and I did manage
  to play a great game of the original Settlers of Catan on Tuesday after Jacob''s
  baseball game. I was ahead 9-6-4 (Jacob in 2nd, Matthew 3rd).  On my next turn I
  would win the game as long as I didn''t roll a 7 - of course I did and lost enough
  cards to prevent me from building my city.  Jacob then managed to steal longest
  road from me, pulling ahead 8-7-4.  Things were tense for a while, but I was able
  to pull out the win by taking back the longest road and building my city. My latest
  eBay purchase arrived: the classic game Camelot (originally Chivalry) by George
  S. Parker, founder of Parker Brothers.  I recently read the book The Game Makers,
  a history of Parker Brothers (great book! I''ll write a review shortly), and this
  game was mentioned frequently as one of GSP''s favorite games. Jacob''s team won
  their baseball tournament last weekend in Gladstone, and are looking good in the
  Sherwood tournament this weekend (2-0, likely heading to the championship game).  Their
  team is also undefeated in league play (team name is Sherwood-Dyer). My parents
  have been in town for about the past 10 days.  It had been a few years since they
  were here and it is has been great having them here for a week of baseball.  Julie''s
  mom was up here for a few days this week as well to look at some property on the
  Oregon coast.'
