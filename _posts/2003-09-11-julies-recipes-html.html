excerpt: 'My wife happens to be an amazing cook.  On the few nights each week that
  we are actually able to site down as a family and eat together, Julie treats us
  very well.  She also knows how to cook for a crowd (I could never get the multiple-dish-timing
  thing down) and our friends and family often ask for copies of her recipes.  She
  keeps track of them electronically so I''ll post them here (254.92 KB).  I thought
  about taking the time to turn her recipe list into some sort of RSS feed, but for
  now you can deal with the plain text. '
