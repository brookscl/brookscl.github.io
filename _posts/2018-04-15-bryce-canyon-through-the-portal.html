<p>One of a few nice shots I got today during my first ever visit to Bryce Canyon National Park. Weather is turning cold and windy but we had some clearish skies for our figure 8 loop down through the amphitheatre.</p>
<p>We are camping here and enjoying our first campfire of the trip. Seems like the winds have been too high or weâ€™ve been in no-burn zones most of the time.</p>
<p>Bryce is beautiful beyond description but I must say I like the parks and monuments with more back country and fewer tour busses a bit more.</p>
