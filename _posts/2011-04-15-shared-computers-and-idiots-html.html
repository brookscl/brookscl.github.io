<p>I'm in NYC right now and got upgraded to a nicer hotel room at the Westin Times Square that included an iMac.  I didn't use the computer, but bumped the mouse on the desk and saw a few things on the <em>desktop</em> that surprised me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidential board meeting minutes for a $160 million law firm headquartered in NYC.</li>
<li>Legal proceedings between two companies engaged in a private compliance dispute over a potential security breach and subsequent audit (and arguments over who should pay for the audit)</li>
<li>An audio file with a voice mail from an HR professional to an executive to discuss compensation concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not kidding.  There were email addresses, names, phone numbers, and <em>sample data from the breach</em>.  I deleted all the files and emptied the trash.  If someone was serious about finding the data they could, but at least it is no longer sitting on the desktop.</p>
