excerpt: Lucas Carlson gave a presentation yesterday on Ruby on Rails in downtown
  Portland.  Looks like there's a lot of local buzz going on regarding Rails.  There's
  a Rails Day scheduled for June 4 that would be fun to join; I'll have to check the
  baseball tournament schedule to see if I'm available.  This would be a great way
  to get a crash course in Rails and try it out on a real application.
