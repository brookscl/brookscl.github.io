excerpt: 'Last weekend I had a small group of friends out at the beach house for some
  gaming.  This is my mostly regular gaming group, the RipCityGamers, and was an experiment
  of sorts.  This group has a long-standing tradition of going to Doug''s Sunriver
  house twice a year; I had the pleasure of attending the event late last spring. 
  I offered up the beach house as an off-cycle choice and several of the core group
  took me up on the offer.  Mike and Eric have already done some writeups on the weekend.
  I drove Jacob and Dave out Thursday evening, stopping for some burgers and frosties
  along the way and arriving about 9:30pm.  After unloading the games, I went to work
  installing some speakers and a receiver while Dave challenged Jacob to a Magic:
  the Gathering duel.  They used a couple of decks I''ve had around for about 7-8
  years with Dave winning easily. Friday morning after canoeing we sat down for a
  game of Runebound.  This game is holding up pretty well for us when played with
  three.  There''s no deep strategy here, but I like the role-playing element (in
  terms of character-buffing and collecting) and downtime has definitely decreased
  as we all learn the game rules.  There''s usually only a small amount of player
  interaction in the game, though in this instance Dave and I went hero vs. hero.         Dave,
  Jacob, and I in the loft for a game of Runebound. Dave had a shot at defeating High
  Lord Margath but couldn''t pull it off.  After several dice rolls left me stranded
  in the hills, I was able to move in and defeat him myself. Next up was Einfach Genial,
  the Knizia abstract released last year.  I quite enjoyed this in my only prior play
  in Melbourne. I''m pleased they didn''t try to paste a theme on this game.  Teaching
  it is simple, scoring is simple, and I think there is probably some serious depth
  in strategy.  Player interaction is high as there are many opportunities to block
  opponents to minimize their scoring opportunities in their weakest colors.  Dave
  blew Jacob and me away; Jacob and I effectively tied with me barely winning on the
  fourth tiebreaker color.           We''ll be simply ingenious. Dave challenged Jacob
  to a chess game, winning handily but providing some good coaching along the way. 
  It would be great if they could play more together - Dave would be a much better
  teacher at this point than I.         Chess near the opening. Next, Dave brought
  out Station Master. This is a relatively new game that I new almost nothing about,
  and I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a light card-game with a serious take-that
  element to it andit was a fun ride.           Dave and Jacob building out their
  trains. Players take the role of station masters, outfitting train locomotives with
  cars and passengers.  Cars are cards played from a player''s hand, while each player
  has a collection of chips representing passengers.  Each chip has a hidden value
  from 1 to 3.  When a train is scored (after it fills up), players score the value
  of the train times their own passenger count.  Sometimes the train value will be
  negative.  There are cards that can swap cars between trains, you can put animal
  cars on passenger trains to spoil them, etc.  Most of the strategy comes in how
  the passenger chips are played.  Fun one and given the low price I''ll probably
  pick up my own copy. The last play of the day before Doug arrived late Friday afternoon
  was A Game of Thrones: CCG.  Dave had been working on a deck so I played a weaker
  deck to try some real playtesting (at least I''m sticking to the story that the
  deck was weaker - couldn''t have been my play).         Dave squares off against
  me in A Game of Thrones: CCG. I like this game for its depth and for the theme -
  most everyone who has read the books in this series is eagerly awaiting the next
  one.  Seeing the characters and locations come to life in the game artwork is very
  appealing.  I held my own in this game for a while, but over time Dave was able
  to dominate and we eventually called the game.'
