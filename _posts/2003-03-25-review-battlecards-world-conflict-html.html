excerpt: 'Overview Battlecards is an expandable (not  collectable) card game of World
  War II.  DGA Games released their Western  European Campaign (Great Britain vs.
  Germany) in 2002 and will be releasing a  Pacific Theater Campaign (United States
  vs. Japan) shortly, with sets for the Russian Front and  African Campaign to follow. 
  When you purchase the basic set you get  three decks: a Great Britain Arsenal deck,
  a Germany Arsenal deck, and a set of  "Conflict" cards.  The Arsenal cards come
  in three flavors: ground, air,  and sea.  The Conflict cards control the events
  of the game. There are 5  expansion sets available for the Western European Campaign
  that add new Arsenal  and Conflict cards. As it stands now (without additional campaigns),
  this is  essentially a two player game (though DGA has published some variant rules
  to  play multiplayer in a single campaign, I haven''t yet tried them). How the Game
  is Played The allied and axis players start with their Arsenal decks, which can
  be  customized with the expansion sets or even additional starter sets.  The  game
  plays just fine with the basic set, and I''ll limit my discussion to that  starting
  configuration.  The deck of Conflict cards is shared by each  player.  Each player
  starts by drawing 6 cards from their Arsenal and  deploying three of them to the
  front.  The deployed Arsenal cards will be  used for battles, and battles may use
  any combination of the ground, air, and  sea forces.  The German player begins the
  game by drawing a Conflict card  and performing the action specified. Conflict cards
  loosely fall into the  following categories:     Military Buildup - allows the player
  to draw cards from the Arsenal deck    into his hand, deploy some of them, and discard
  the rest   Retained Action - allows the player to hold onto a card for later use.     These
  cards can be used to disrupt the enemy''s actions or give bonuses in   future battles.    Immediate
  Action - allows the player to immediately take an action to   help their own forces
  or disrupt the enemy.  Examples include capturing    an enemy unit or reorganizing
  a deployed stack of cards into two stacks     (Divide & Conquer)     Battle - allows
  the player to enter into battle with the enemy if the   pre-requisites are met and
  if the aggressor chooses to fight.  The combat system is fairly straightforward
  but does present some twists that  caused confusion initially.  Each Arsenal card
  has 6 numbered attributes:  attack values for ground, air, and sea, and defense
  values for ground, air, and  sea.  In addition, each arsenal card has a firing phase
  from 1 to 4.   Combat occurs in phases: all phase 1 units get to fire first (aggressor
  then  defender), then phase 2, etc.  This allows, for example, anti-aircraft guns  to
  shoot down enemy planes before they get a chance to attack.  Combat is  resolved
  by using the Conflict deck as a random number generator.  Let''s  say a bomber is
  attempting to attack an enemy ship.  The bomber has a sea  attack value of 15, while
  the ship has an air defense value of 5.  The  attacker draws a card from the Conflict
  deck, and if it is greater than the  defense value but less than or equal to the
  attack value (in this case, from 6  to 15), then the enemy ship is destroyed.  At
  the end of the 4 phases if  either player has lost all of the Arsenal, then combat
  is over and the winner  gets to keep the Battlecard.  If forces still remain, either
  player can  choose to withdraw and concede victory to the other player but still
  retain some  of their forces. Some Arsenal cards are weak in and of themselves in
  combat, but provide  valuable bonuses to other units.  Fighter, for example, are
  usually most  valuable either shooting down other planes or providing support to
  bombers  through combat bonuses (sounds like real life, yes?).  It is these  capabilities
  that create for interesting tactical and strategic decisions in the  game - there
  are a limited number of powerful cards, so a balance of forces is  critical.  In
  our games we''ve found the battleships to be the most powerful  units - they fire
  early in the round (phase 2) and several of them can fire up  to 4 times. Play continues
  until one player wins a key final battle or achieves a certain  number of victory
  points.  This game is quite long - I play with my two  sons (ages 6 and 8) and we
  find ourselves often stopping after 90 minutes with  only half of the victory points
  achieved.  A full game will last from 2 to  3 hours. The Arsenal and Conflict decks
  get cycled several times during the course of  a game, and it is rare for card to
  be eliminated from the game completely  (leader assassinations are one example).
  Quality of Components The card quality is outstanding -  better than any collectable
  card game  I''ve played and with outstanding photography for artwork.  I wish more
  card  game manufacturers would go with The rules could use some work - I would prefer  a
  small booklet version of the rules and it needs more explanation of certain  characteristics
  of the game, particularly the special combat effects of certain  cards.  The online
  FAQ  makes up for this, but the rules should be more self-contained.  Hopefully  they''ll
  fix this with some of the upcoming expansions.  Future expansions  will also come
  with a placemat with areas for deck and deployed forces placement  as well as a
  rules summaryS. Quality of Game Play I love playing this game, and look forward
  to exploring the subtleties of  force deployment and deck construction in future
  games.  There is tension  created when Battlecards are drawn - should I go into
  combat yet?  Should I  wait until I deploy more forces, potentially allowing your
  opponent to do the  same?  There are also difficult choices in Arsenal card deployment
  - should  I focus on balancing forces or should I beef up just my air and sea forces  initially? 
  I played most of the Avalon Hill hex-based wargames back in the  day, and I love
  games with WWII themes.  This is clearly a simpler game  than any of those, but
  with the shorter playing time combined with the quality  artwork and depiction of
  forces, I''ll be playing this one for a while.  For  now I''ll be rating this game
  an 8 - it might get an even higher score with the  upcoming release of the expansions
  and potential for strong multiplayer  campaigns. '
