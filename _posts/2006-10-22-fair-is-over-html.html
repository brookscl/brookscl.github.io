excerpt: 'I''m sitting here in Carey''s bathroom while Carey, Linda, Lorna, and Erik
  work on packing our various leftovers (not many!) and acquisitions into our return
  luggage.  It might all fit. I want to say thank you to our booth helpers this year:
  Lorna, Jim, Marty, Erik, Tim, Carrie, Ben - thank you for your support of Sunriver
  Games and for donating your time and energy to making it another successful year. 
  We had a great celebration dinner at the Ystra tonight and the wine, food, and Narnia
  improv by Erik were memorable. I got in a turn of Pillars of the Earth (Die Saulen
  der Erde) when Jim had to leave the game early to meet up with Ben.  This is a good
  game and I''m sorry I missed out on getting it (prices were going up during the
  day as the game was in short supply), but no fear - looks like Mayfair will have
  an English version early 2007.  This is the game to play if you want a shorter version
  of Caylus with an even stronger graphical design. I''ll do a more in-depth post-Essen
  report once I return where I can include some photos.'
