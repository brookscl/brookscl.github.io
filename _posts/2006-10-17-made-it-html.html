excerpt: Customs and security didn't slow us down too much and we are sitting on a
  B737 for our flight to Dusseldorf. Carey, Linda, KC, Marty (KC's dad), and Lorna
  Wong are all with me on this flight. We'll split two cabs for our trip to the Hotel
  Arosa. Hopefully our luggage will make it given the tight connection.   This is
  my 3rd time in Frankfurt this year for a connection, though the first time I'll
  be staying in Germany since last year's Essen trip.   The rest of today will involve
  staying awake (maybe a run in the park?), getting settled in the hotel, and prepping
  for setup tomorrow at the show. More on that soon - we should have a much nicer
  setup this year.
