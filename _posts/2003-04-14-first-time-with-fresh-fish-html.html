excerpt: "     I received my copy of Fresh     Fish from Plenary Games on Saturday
  \    and got a chance to play it for the first time tonight.  Julie humored me with
  \    a quick 2-player game.  I'll do a more thorough review shortly, but I have
  to     say that I can't wait to play this with 3 or 4 players.  Fresh Fish is a
  tile     placement game with a small auction element and a big puzzle/deduction
  element.      The rules are very simple, but I can see the strategies being quite
  complex.      This game only took about 15 minutes to finish; I would guess that
  each additional     player would add 10-15 minutes.                      "
