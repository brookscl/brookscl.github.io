excerpt: 'Man, it has been a long time!  95 years in fact - 1908 was the last time
  the Cubs managed to win a post-season series.  In my lifetime, it has been one heartbreak
  after another.  There was the collapse in 1969, the disaster in San Diego in 1984,
  and the letdowns in 1989 and 1998.  Not to mention the multitude of losing seasons. 
  Up until this year, I think I was one of about 120,000 people in the world that
  had ever seen the Cubs win a postseason game - I was at their only victory in 1989
  at Wrigley against the Giants.  Tonight, the Cubs won their division series against
  the Braves.  Onto the NLCS! '
