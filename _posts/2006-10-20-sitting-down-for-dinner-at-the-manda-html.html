excerpt: 'We have our crew plus Matthias and Ina Catrain - Matthias is our artist
  for Incan Gold. I''m sipping a Paulaner Weissbier and we are having some great conversation.
  Cool note - most of the waitresses you''ll see along our street are wearing our
  "Gamers do it 24/7" buttons.   Another good day - sold out of the Havoc expansion
  and we are running out of Havoc. 24/7 did well - sold about 30 today and we shipped
  a bunch to Funagain. We need to project final sales and send the rest out tomorrow.   Had
  a great meeting with the folks at Kosmos who are thinking of adding 24/7 to their
  abstract line (Ubongo and Ingenious). We''ll see but Wolfgang Ludtke seemed to like
  the game. And they like the multiplayer / partner aspect.   All I bought today:
  Vallhala for Mike and 3 copies of Bohnanza and saboteur for the games class. Very
  restrained I must say.   Oh, and KC''s dad''s name is Marty not Mary (if you looked
  at the photos).   Till next time...'
