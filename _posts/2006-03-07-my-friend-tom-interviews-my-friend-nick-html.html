excerpt: 'Tom Vasel recently posted an interview of Nick Medinger, head of marketing
  for Funagain Games.  I had the pleasure of spending quite a bit of time with Nick
  at Essen last year – he’s a great guy and much younger than you’d think given his
  role.  This interview is worth reading to learn about Funagain’s view of doing exclusives
  (like Havoc and Carcassonne: the Discovery).'
