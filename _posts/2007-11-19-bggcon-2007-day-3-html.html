excerpt: 'Saturday was full of great gaming and even better Texas BBQ thanks to a
  trip to the Baby Back Shack courtesy of Tim and Carrie.  The day did not start off
  to well, though, as Jim and I tried out the new Essen release Oregon and were disappointed.   Given
  the name I was hoping for something thematic that might even be interesting to use
  in my school games class, but this is just the next game in a series of dry Euros
  with no connection between theme and mechanics.  I can live with that - I like Knizia''s
  Genesis quite a bit - when the mechanics are engaging and fun, but unfortunately
  that''s not the case for Oregon.  The mechanics work like this:  You start your
  turn with four cards that are either locations or buildings (you must have at least
  one of each).  The locations designate rows and columns, and you can place your
  meeple in any of 6 squares in the intersection of the row and column of two location
  cards that you play.  Because the locations repeat across both horizontal and vertical
  axes, you actually have two 6-square choices for most row/column combinations, the
  only exception being when you play the same card twice (e.g., bison / bison).  If
  you play a location card with a building, then you can place one of 6 or so different
  buildings in any square in the row or column matching that location.  Whenever you
  place a meeple, you score it based on proximity to buildings orthogonally and diagonally.  Whenever
  you place a building, you score all meeples adjacent to it according to the same
  rules as meeple placement.  Some of the buildings give you some special abilities.  Repeat
  until one player runs out of meeples - that''s the game.  This sort of game just
  isn''t my cup of tea any more, and I''m very happy I had a chance to play it before
  purchasing as I was getting close to purchasing it based on the title.  Fortunately
  our next game was much better.  Two years ago at BGG.CON Asmodee was running pre-production
  demos of Mission: Red Planet but I missed out on trying it then and two years later
  I still hadn''t played the game.  Jim had checked this out of the library the night
  before so we sat down to teach ourselves and try it. Kris Wolff joined us and we
  played the game in 40 minutes and had a blast.  I suspect it has already been characterized
  as a streamlined El Grande combined with Citadels, though it did feel a little less
  cut-throat than Citadels to me.  I didn''t do very well (Jim won) but could have
  won with a different hidden event card played in one region where I had a majority
  (monopoly) that drastically lowered my score.  A game with this much action going
  on that can be played in 30 minutes is likely to become a purchase for me.  I love
  the theme, but I do wish the components were higher quality. I snuck into the admin
  area of the convention to dig through Greg Schloesser''s bag of goodies from Essen
  and grabbed Cuba, a game clearly influenced by Puerto Rico but with enough differences
  to make it worth considering. Russell Moll joined Tim, Carrie, Jim, and I in a five
  player game that lasted about 1 hour 50 minutes.  The economic system is Cuba will
  be familiar - a set of base resources and goods that can be turned into final products
  like Rum and Cigars, used to construct buildings, or sold in local or overseas markets
  for money and victory points.  This aspect of the game is very similar to Puerto
  Rico, but where it differs is in the role selection process.  Each player has five
  role cards and in a given turn will use four of them to move their economy along,
  selecting one at a time as you go around the all players four times.  The player
  mat for each player also has some interesting characteristics in how you can manage
  the production of resources, and as you construct buildings you take away resource
  production slots.  Finally, there''s a game-wide context that changes throughout
  play as players vote on various bills to pass into laws.  These effect the game
  by imposing taxes and tariffs while giving some rewards based on the current state
  of a player''s economy.  The voting mechanism is interesting and these bills will
  likely add to replayability of the game. The quality of the components is outstanding
  - great colors and artwork and lots of high quality wooden bits (my favorites are
  the rum bottles).  You probably have a good idea by now if you''ll like this game. 
  I do, and I will probably purchase this one when I can get my hands on the English
  version.  After our BBQ run and a 10 minute nap, Jim held a spot for me in a forming
  Agricola game with Jeff Deboer and Melissa and Will Demorris.  If you listened to
  some people at BGG.CON, this is the NEXT BIG THING in gaming that will take the
  world by storm over the next year.  So many people were playing it and discussing
  it that I felt like I had a pretty decent idea of what to expect going into the
  game.  Agricola (I think you aren''t supposed to pronounce that so it rhymes with
  Diet Cola, don''t ask me how you do pronounce it though) has a feel like Roads and
  Boats in that you start with close to nothing but a set of initial conditions (a
  two-room house and a husband/wife) to allow you to bootstrap your engine and build
  a mini economy - in this case a prosperous farm.  The game works and is quite good. 
  I had only two complaints, and both were based on the fact that we were playing
  a pasted up version of the German edition of the game.  The iconography was a challenge
  at times (what''s the symbol for stone?) and the action selection board had parts
  in German that I had to just remember as the game went on.  What may keep this game
  evergreen is the cards - I think there are over 300 of them that describe occupations
  and innovations relevant to period farming. The game oozes theme and the mechanics
  are solid, though play does feel mostly solitaire with a small amount of interaction
  and competition in the middle board as players choose actions. I''m tempted to pre-order
  this with Z-Man games but it would be nice to know what the components are going
  to be like.  The game is crying out for wooden bits that represent the sheep, cows,
  farmers, etc. as something other than discs and cubes.  Zev told us they are trying
  to make that happen but he''s not sure if he can keep the costs down to meet the
  price point he has set (I think $60 pre-order and $70 or $75 retail).  Our game
  took about 3 hours and it appears to scale linearly with the number of players. 
  Oh, and this should be an excellent solitaire game and may invite competition as
  players could play solo starting from the same hand of occupations and innovations
  and compare scores.  Jim and Will managed a tie with Jeff not too far behind.  I
  ended the game with the smallest house (at least it was stone) and fewest number
  of children but still had a respectable score of 26 (the winners had 34).  My occupations
  and innovations discouraged me from expanding my house early and gave me victory
  points for taking a very different path than everyone else did, which added flavor
  to the game.  Jim has owned Hansa for a while but never played it, so Jeff and I
  agreed to play this fun but dry trading game of the Hanseatic League.  I''ve never
  wanted to own the game, but it is fun and fairly quick - we played in about an hour. 
  Not much to say here as this game has been out for several years.  I won with 39
  points, Jeff was close behind with 37.  After a few beers in the bar we came back
  to the game room to play Louis XIV.  Jeff and Jim are both sharks in this game,
  having played it quite a bit in their local groups.  I''ve never played the game
  and wanted to try it given how much they play it.  I insisted that we just start
  the game and allow me to make mistakes as I played, and boy did I ever.  They both
  played extremely well and it came down to the final actions with Jim winning narrowly
  51-50.  There''s a lot of game in that small box and I would gladly play this again,
  though I''m not sure that I need to own it. That was it for Saturday - we finished
  at close to 3am on Sunday and the game room was still thriving with activity.  I''ll
  post a day 4 report shortly, followed by a summary of all of the games I played
  with recommendations.'
