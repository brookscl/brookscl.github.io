<p>This was clearly a down year in <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/plays/bygame/user/CaptainCaveman/subtype/boardgame/start/2010-01-01/end/2010-12-31">my games played in 2010</a> with only two "nickels": Thunderstone and 18xx. A few games knocked on the door: the perennial favorite Magic: the Gathering, Castle Ravenloft (I've now hit five plays in the last month having played it the last two days), Claustrophobia, 7 Wonders, and Time's Up. I guarantee that if I owned 7 Wonders it would have made the list!</p>
<p>Having already played Thunderstone twice this year (once trying it out solo, once with Matthew) I'm confident that it will at least be a nickel in 2011.</p>
