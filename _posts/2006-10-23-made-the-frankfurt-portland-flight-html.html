excerpt: Barely... Again. Last year it was the crazy drive from Essen to Franfurt
  with five of us in a small car with bags stacked to our noses. This year it was
  a delayed flight into Frankfurt followed by the usual passport control and secondary
  screening. In the end we are all on board and safely on our way. One interesting
  catch was that we were only allowed a single carry-on for the first leg, forcing
  Carey and Linda to check two extra bags. Marty has settled right in and is explaining
  our purpose for being here and giving all sorts of details to a very attentive German
  woman sitting next to him.
