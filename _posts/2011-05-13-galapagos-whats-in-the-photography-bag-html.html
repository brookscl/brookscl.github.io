<p>My preparation for photography in Galapagos began in earnest in about September 2010.  My starting point for equipment (body, lenses, accessories) was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canon 7D body</li>
<li>Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom</li>
<li>Sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens</li>
<li>Canon 50mm f/1.8 lenses</li>
<li>Kenko Teleplus 1.4x Teleconverter </li>
<li>Hoya 77mm Circular Polarizer</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-CompuDaypack-Camera-Burnt-Orange/dp/B000EY1LCI" title="Amazon.com: Lowepro CompuDaypack Camera Bag (Burnt Orange): Camera &amp; Photo">Lowepro CompuDaypack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great set of equipment for night-time sports photography and indoor candids, but not ideal for wildlife or landscapes.  My Kenko teleconverter had languished mostly unused for the past 2 years because of poor sharpness and autofocus responsiveness.  The 200mm focal length of my go-to 70-200mm lens also wouldn't cut it for bird shots unless I got within 10 feet.  And none of these lenses would do justice for landscapes, especially given the 1.6x magnification from my crop sensor on the 7D.</p>
<p>My research was conducted both online and hands-on.  I'm fortunate to have Portland Pro Photo Supply here in town which offers affordable rentals for just about every Canon lens currently in production.  During football season I rented a few different wide angle lenses, trying both the 14mm f/2.8 and the 16-35mm f/2.8.  While I adored the 14mm lens, a combination of cost and reduced flexibility steered me towards the wide angle zoom lens.</p>
<p>Choosing the right telephoto lens turned about to be a bigger challenge.  I've rented both the 300mm f/2.8 and the 600mm f/2.8 lenses in the past, and while they are amazing lenses the sheer bulk and exorbitant cost quickly ruled them out. I spent time researching recommendations in various online forums discussing Galapagos photography and concluded that the 100mm-400mm f/4.5 telephoto zoom would be a good option. I rented the lens and used for some local bird photography and found the sharpness lacking.  I also discovered that when shooting birds I was always hanging out at 400mm.  Do I even need a zoom?  Probably not.</p>
<p>My next attempt was the Canon 300mm f/4 prime lens - a relatively affordable option, and a lens with a built-in hood that is roughly the same size as my 70-200mm zoom. I rented the lens and loved it.  Didn't miss the zoom, though I did miss having a 400mm focal length.  Knowing that my current Kenko teleconverter wasn't cutting it, I decided that my best option would be a combination of the 300mm f/4 with the Canon brand 1.4x teleconverter.  Note that this teleconverter reduces the maximum aperture to f/5.6, but given that I would be shooting birds in bright sunlight this didn't concern me.  When you combine the crop factor lens magnification with the teleconverter, the 300mm lens becomes a 300mm x 1.6 x 1.4 = 672mm effective focal length.</p>
<p>Spending 10 days on a trip taking what would likely be at least 500 photos a day without a backup solution was scaring me.  I did not plan on bringing a laptop so searched for other backup solutions.  I settled on a decent choice that I viewed as somewhat risky given the reviews I read: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Foci-PST-251-Picture-Storage/dp/B00378KLFQ" title="Amazon.com: Digital Foci Photo Safe II PST-251 500 GB Digital Picture Storage (Blue/White): Camera &amp; Photo">Photo Safe II portable hard drive</a> with embedded LCD screen and CF and SD card slots.  The device is amazingly easy to use: you turn it on, stick in card, then push a button to do a backup to the embedded hard drive (500GB).  It worked flawlessly throughout the trip, though fortunately I never had to rely on it.  I brought 4 32GB CF cards, 1 16GB CF card, 2 4GB CF cards, and 2 2GB CF cards.</p>
<p>The final piece of equipment turned out to be a surprise: Julie and the boys gave me an (unrequested) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-SlingShot-202-AW/dp/B0036AWR8E/">LowePro Slingshot</a> bag for my birthday in December.  This turned out to be the perfect size for the lenses I would take with me to Galapagos, and extremely useful in the field as I could change lens without removing the bag.</p>
<p>My final equipment list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canon 7D body</li>
<li>Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM telephoto zoom</li>
<li>Canon EF 300mm f/4L IS USM telephoto</li>
<li>Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II wide angle zoom</li>
<li>Canon EF 1.4X II Extender</li>
<li>Hoya 77mm Circular Polarizer</li>
<li>LowePro SlingShot</li>
<li>Photo Safe II 500GB storage</li>
<li>Various CF cards</li>
<li>Backup Canon 30D body</li>
</ul>
