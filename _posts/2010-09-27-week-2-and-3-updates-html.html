<p>I'm behind on game updates – let’s catch up on games 2 and 3.</p>
<h3>Game 2 – Tigard</h3>
<p>We played a very strong Tigard team a week ago and came up short, losing the special teams battle as they made all of their PATs and we managed only one 1-point conversion. We played in a downpour but it didn’t stop their passing game. They have a very strong QB and #1 receiver. We had a chance on a final drive into their redzone but couldn’t get it into the end zone.</p>
<h3>Game 3 – Lake Oswego</h3>
<p>The last time I played a Lake Oswego game was three years ago in the championship (we lost). This game ended up being a one-sided affair as we got up 30-0 by early in the 2nd quarter, with two pick six interceptions putting the game away. This allowed us to play a bunch of kids in different positions in the 2nd half but we had to ensure that we didn’t score again to avoid a score run-up forfeit. I really wish they added a running clock in situations like this as the entire half was a bit torturous for all of us.</p>
<h3>This Week</h3>
<p>We are going to focus on special teams (kickoff and kick return) and a new pass-oriented formation and series.</p>
