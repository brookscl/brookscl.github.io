excerpt: I'll be using this space to talk about gaming (boardgames  mostly), technology,
  software development, and just random thoughts. I'm the CTO at  Corillian Corporation,
  and we provide  software and services for banks, credit unions, and other financial  institutions.
  I'm a family man, with two amazing boys and a beautiful wife. One of my favorite
  hobbies is games, primarily German-style boardgames.   You can learn more about
  these types of games at BoardGameGeek; you can even view my  ever-expanding collection  there. 
  I'll periodically post game reviews, session reports, and other  items of interest
  for gamers here.  If you are ever in the Portland, OR  area and want to meet up
  for some gaming, let me know.
