excerpt: 'The Monday after Thanksgiving weekend (Nov 27) I traveled to Israel for
  the second time this year on Corillian business.  Scary thing is, I''m growing used
  to the routine.  This trip involved a staggered schedule with me and my comprades
  at Corillian to account for different meetings and a firm desire by me not to travel
  on Thanksgiving weekend.  I arrived Tuesday afternoon and after a long taxi ride
  due to traffic checked into my room at the Dan Tel Aviv on the Med coast.  The next
  two days involved a series of business and technical discussions with an Israeli
  Bank - always exhausting but rewarding at the same time.  On Friday Debra, Scott,
  and I rented a car and drove to Jerusalem to meet our pre-arranged guide (thanks
  to Yehuda) at the Jaffa Gate of the old city.  It took longer than we expected -
  though the distances are short, traffic and navigation can be a challenging.  After
  a few passes by the parking lot (we almost circled the old city) we parked in the
  garage and walked up to our guide.  Yehuda came along for the tour as well - nice
  to have the company of another local.  The guide was fantastic, and like many of
  the locals we''ve met in Jerusalem, he is from North America originally (Baltimore
  in this case).  He has been doing this for 15-20 years and is deep on the history
  and topology of Jerusalem.  I say topology because he continually referred to the
  peaks and valleys of the area and how it has affected the development of the city
  over the years.  A common phrase: "this place is venerated as the...", followed
  by a pragmatic (skeptical) accounting of how it is unlikely to the actual place
  where [the last supper was held, Jesus was crucified, Jesus was entombed, etc.]. 
  His commentary was not biased by any religious perspective (in my view) but certainly
  colored by his understanding of the history of the area.   Our time spent was primarily
  in the Christian and Jewish quarters - once again our timing was bad to enter the
  Muslim quarter so I must coordinate and plan better next time.  We did get a chance
  to peer into the quarter through a security checkpoint and snap some photos.  In
  the mid afternoon we had a bit of logistical coordination to work through - get
  our car out of the parking garage (closes at 3pm), and get Yehuda back home before
  the start of Shabbat (about 5:30pm-ish).  We decided to take a cab from the Zion
  gate and were greated with the all-too-familiar flat rate proposal from a cabbie
  (30 NIS for a 2 minute ride??) who happened to be Arab - apparently he took both
  of us for tourists based on our western looks.  I may be a tourist but I''ve been
  there enough to ask him to turn on the meter instead and he refused.  As we walked
  away his parting words to me were "he is a Jew, you are a Christian - what are you
  doing together??"  We found another cab, got back to the car and I dropped Yehuda
  off at home.  I returned back to the Zion gate and parked there - the lots were
  emptying as the religious Jews worked there way back home to start Shabbat.  I met
  back up with the group and we expored some other areas and enjoyed the sunset. 
  One of the areas was a building that may have housed the upper room that held the
  last supper, was a mosque for a while, and is now a synagogue.  From the top of
  that building we enjoyed a beautiful sunset and shortly thereafter bid farewell
  to our guide.  In case you wondered, a full day tour like that (about 7 hours) costs
  about $150 - $200.  We were eager to go visit the Western Wall (aka wailing wall)
  at the start of Shabbat.  As we walked down the winding streets of the old city,
  a pretty young (and pregnant) Jewish mother came running down an alley and asked
  me if I was Jewish in a frantic voice.  I told her no, and she asked me if I could
  come turn her oven off - she had mistakenly left it on past the start of Shabbat. 
  I complied and we followed her to her home where a nice spread was set out for Shabbat
  dinner and took care of the oven for her.  I figured I could probably get a nice
  dinner out of the deal if I asked nicely, but perhaps that would be pushing her
  hospitality.  Scott and Debra then dropped my off at Yehuda''s home and began their
  drive back to Tel Aviv to get some sleep before their early flights the next morning. 
  I enjoyed a very nice extended family and friends dinner hosted by Yehuda and his
  wife Rachel.  I''ve always felt very comfortable in settings like that (I''ve attended
  many Jewish meals during high holidays) but at times I feel that I make them uncomfortable
  - or maybe they are all just very shy!  I''m fine talking away and telling stories,
  and I always enjoy the story telling and dialog initiated by Rachel (she went to
  Reed College right here in Portland, by the way). After dinner we sat down for some
  gaming.  I avoided another spanking at Puerto Rico by teaching Yehuda and his son
  how to play our new game 24/7.  I think it was received pretty well.  We also played
  Yehuda''s Menorah game - VERY enjoyable with three and I''m glad I got a copy to
  take home with me.  We ended the evening of gaming with a learning game of Tichu.
  Now most groups will sit attentively as I teach Tichu (I''m no expert myself - I
  still have to refer back to the rules to play and teach it), but this group... I''m
  not even halfway through the rules and scoring when they learned about how cards
  are passed.  Yehuda and crew proceed to digress into an in-depth discussion of the
  merits of different passing strategies and signals, e.g., I''ll always pass odd,
  you always pass even, if I pass a dragon, that means my hand is weak, etc.  And
  they haven''t even played a hand yet!  I scold them, saying that they shouldn''t
  even consider such strategies until they are much more familiar with the game but
  I think deep in my heart I was flustered as I realized that they probably already
  grasp more of the subtleties of the game than I have after 10 plays or so. Saturday
  morning found me searching for something to do - not for lack of options, but for
  lack of decisiveness.  I had a quick coffee with Yehuda then saw him off to Saturday
  morning services, grabbed my camera, then walked out the door.  I was thinking I
  would walk to the promenade overlooking the old city, but was also considering a
  trip to Bethlehem.  Yehuda and I discussed that option in the morning and he advised
  me that it should be safe for me.  So when a taxi came my way as I strolled towards
  the promenade, I hailed it and asked for a ride to Bethlehem. Clearly the cabbie
  was surprised, and he indicated that he would have to drive me around the security
  wall as he was unable to go through the checkpoint.  I shrugged my shoulders and
  said "OK, let''s go".  20 minutes later I found myself outside the nativity church
  in Bethlehem - one of only about 10 or so westerners (that I saw) visiting the area
  that day. The church was interesting but I didn''t find it that moving.  The main
  cathedral is fairly smoked out and has apparently been the holding place for Palestenian
  millitants at least once over the past 2-3 years.  Underneath the main alter is
  the nativity alter where it is venerated that Jesus was born - this is the manger
  grotto.  Of course it is divided into at least two sections - one the Orthodox Christians
  own, and another the Catholics own.  I couldn''t figure out where the Methodists
  are supposed to go.  I then wondered around the wonderful Arab / Palestinian market
  near the church for the next hour or so, taking in the sites and smells, sipping
  some coffee, and eating shawarma.  My flight to Frankfurt was due to depart at about
  4pm, so around 11:30am or so I needed to work my way back to Jerusalem.  I walked
  down the hill from the church area to one of the main strips leading into Bethlehem,
  hoping to find a taxi.  I found one but he could only take me to the checkpoint.  Unfortunately
  this checkpoint was only for vehicles - the guard repeatedly waved his M-16 at me,
  telling me to go around to the pedestrian checkpoint.  It was an obvious where that
  place was as it could have been, but a friendly local offered a short drive to the
  checkpoint.  I knew I would owe him something upon my arrival (it was about a 90
  second drive) and it turned out the fee would be the purchase of a few necklaces
  which I gladly performed.  The trip through the checkpoint was interesting - two
  different metal detectors and I had to show my papers.  When you hear about the
  challenges of access and travel between the different parts of the Palestinian Authority
  (PA), this is likely one of the concerns.  I won''t get into the politics of the
  whole situation there.  I do encourage you to read the Good Neighbors blog, of which
  Yehuda is a contributor. Clearly the story of Israel and Palestine is still being
  written.'
