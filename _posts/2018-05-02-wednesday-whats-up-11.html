<ul>
<li><a href="https://letgrow.org/free-range-kids-bill-signed-law-utah-first-nation/">Free Range Kids Bill Signed in Utah</a> – Odd that there needs to be a law for this but I can get behind the concept.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I listened to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2293537109?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Fall of Giants</a> and Winter of the World by Ken Follett. Average books but they did keep me engaged during my commutes. Not sure if I’ll read the final book of the trilogy.</li>
<li>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2253408759?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">The Republic of Thieves</a>, finishing the Gentleman Bastard series. I think the quality declined slightly with each book though enjoyed the series overall.</li>
<li>Julie and I listened to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2340282673?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">The Litigators</a> as we started our road trip and it was quite fun.</li>
<li>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2333411878?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Origin</a>, the latest Dan Brown novel and it was better than expected.</li>
<li>Our highlight of the last month was listening to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2369365764?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Lonesome Dove</a>. Superb writing and characters and we can’t wait to watch the classic made-for-TV mini series.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Doug and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28197104">Up Front</a> before I left on our road trip. Fun as always; wish I owned this game.</li>
<li>My first game at <a href="http://www.insidegmt.com/?event=gmt-weekend-at-the-warehouse-april-26-29-2018">GMT West</a> was <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28780730">Colonial Twilight: The French-Algerian War, 1954–62</a>. I’m about to give up on this game. Not that I think it is a bad game; I just don’t grok it yet and don’t know if I will. I want to play one time solo this week (maybe today) before I put it on the sell/trade list.</li>
<li>I tried out a new short Arnhem scenario of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28783500">Holland ’44: Operation Market-Garden</a> and think this will be the best way to play a short (5-ish hour) game. 15 turns and the 30 corps show up on turn 8 or so.</li>
<li>I taught three newbies how to play <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28792731">Pax Renaissance</a> at GMT West. I’m getting better at teaching the game but can’t say I’m figuring out how to play well. This will go to Keuka Lake with me this summer again.</li>
<li>Played a four-player scenario of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28797834">Advanced Squad Leader</a> that was a lot of fun. Didn’t quite finish as we all had to break for dinner.</li>
<li>I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28812810">D-Day Dice</a> with <a href="http://wargamestogo.libsyn.com">Mark Johnson</a> and two others at GMT West. This is a keeper in my collection and we successfully took Utah Beach.</li>
<li>The new hotness at GMT West was <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28820528">Great War Commander on 2018–04–28</a> and this was the last game I played. It is <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21050/combat-commander-europe">Combat Commander: Europe</a> tweaked for World War I. There will likely be some complaints about realism but I welcome the new scenarios and factions. Some fun artillery, tank, and air support cards as well.</li>
</ul>
