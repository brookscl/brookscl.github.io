<p>Ken and I are trying to reserve Wednesday nights for two player wargaming (lighter stuff) and last night was our second try of <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62222/commands-colors-napoleonics">Command and Colors:Napoleonics</a>. We moved to the second scenario, Rolica - Second Position, with me again playing the French. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/5392374088/" title="Ken as Brits - CC Napoleonics by brookscl, on Flickr"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/01/5392374088_7d07a14ffb.jpg" alt="Ken as Brits - CC Napoleonics" /></a></p>
<p>Ken opened with a quick strategic move on his left flank that put significant early pressure on my right. I had a strong repelling move from my hilltop position but Ken was persistent and gradually wiped out my right flank. Unfortunately I subsequently was holding onto 3 right flank cards which seriously hampered my options. It was still a great battle with Ken winning 5-2 and the game finishing in about 90 minutes. </p>
<p>We are getting the hang of the tweaks in this edition, namely the value of infantry squares and cavalry retirements. There are still some <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/612204/firing-up-hill-line-of-site-combined-arms">line of site rules</a> that I think need clarifying and it is hard to keep straight (in our heads) the light vs line infantry differences. Still I think we both feel this is the best of the series so far.</p>
