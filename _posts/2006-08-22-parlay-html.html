excerpt: I failed to mention that I played Parlay recently at one of our lunchtime
  gaming sessions at work.  I met Jennifer and Paul Sturgis, designers and owners
  of Real Deal Games, at Origins and picked up a couple of copies of the game.  I
  only managed a quick demo with Paul at the show, but we had a great time chatting
  about the gaming business and came to learn that we have a lot in common – Parlay
  was conceived while Jennifer and Paul were living in Sunriver, OR. Parlay combines
  a word-game mechanic (similar to Alpha Playing Cards) with a creative poker mechanic. 
  We played the 7–card Texas hold ‘em variant that plays like the game we all know
  and love, but instead of betting rounds players get the option to exchange hole
  cards.  After all five common cards are turned up, players then decide to stay or
  fold.  If you fold, you get to score the word value of the best word you can make
  with your hole and the common cards.  If you stay, you are competing for the best
  hand point total, which will be a combination of your poker hand (you get a bonus
  if you have the best poker hand), word bonuses for length, and (maybe) bluff bonuses
  for calling others on their fictional words. There was more tension in the stay/fold
  decision than I expected.  It doesn’t feel like you are betting ala poker – it is
  more of a press-your-luck, all-or-nothing mechanic.  Do I take the safe points and
  score my word, or do I try and double up and pull far away from the others? While
  you probably won’t like this game if you don’t enjoy word games (Scrabble, Boggle,
  etc.), if you do it is worth picking up and playing.  Everyone in our group of five
  enjoyed the game and at least one player immediately went out and purchased his
  own copy.
