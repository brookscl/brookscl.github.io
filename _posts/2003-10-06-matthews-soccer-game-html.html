excerpt: 'Wow, it sure has been a while since I posted an entry.  I was in Chicago
  all of last week at our customer conference and got a bit behind.  Matthew had a
  bye week in soccer this weekend, but I have some pictures from last Saturday where
  he score eight goals in his game.  We can''t help but think it is mostly due to
  his size and speed, but for his first year playing we are certainly amazed.    One
  of the parents from the other team jokingly exclaimed "get that 12 year old off
  the field".  We''ll enjoy it while we can.  It sure is doing a lot to boost his
  confidence which can only help him in the future.    A few other random notes:   Jacob''s
  football team continued its undefeated streak, winning over Wilsonville this Saturday. 
  Jacob had another solid game - no fumbled snaps, and he made three tackles on defense.
  I volunteer to teach chess at Archer Glen elementary this year.  I''ll be teaching
  two classes a week until spring break - one for grades 1-3, and another for grades
  4-5.  This will be fun, though I really need to improve my skills. I''m sitting
  here watching the Chicago Cubs play in game 5 of the NLDS.  They are up 4-0, and
  the collective world of Cub fans are crossing their fingers.  It has been waaay
  too long!'
