excerpt: I saw Wilco in Bend on Saturday night. Check out some nice photos at this
  guy's Flickr set. This might be the best concert I've ever seen. The last time I
  saw Jeff Tweedy live was in the Cicero's basement bar in 1989 while attending Washington
  University. I will try not to ever miss him again if lands anywhere close to Portland.
