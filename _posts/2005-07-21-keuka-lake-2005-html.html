excerpt: 'Here are some snapshots from this year''s visit to Keuka Lake in western
  NY (we do this every year - read more here).         Julie''s college roomate Deb
  joined us for the July 4 weekend; I took her new husband Eli and son Philip out
  sailing on the flying dutchman.         Philip loved playing Mystery Rummy: Jack
  the Ripper (my new favorite).  Recommendation: listen to the GeekSpeak interview
  of this game''s designer Mike Fitzgerald.         We had a rousing game of Bang!
  that everyone enjoyed.         At the very end of our trip last year we picked up
  a used Walker Bay rowboat.  This is now one of Jacob''s favorite activities, though
  Matthew certainly enjoys being a passenger.         We had a great skiing year -
  Jacob was able to get up and stay up on a slalom ski (not shown here) and Matthew
  was able to ski on two.         Jacob and I spent three mornings out fishing deep
  for lake trout.  We did reasonably well, cooking fish for two meals.  This picture
  was our big surprise - a 19 inch largemouth caught about 40 feet below the surface.
