excerpt: "              I enjoyed a fun night of gaming last week while visiting Bellevue/Redmond. 
  There's         a group that meets weekly on Tuesdays at the WizKids         Storefront
  in Redmond, so I headed up from Portland a little early to join in         on the
  fun. Fantastic group of people - very welcoming and I hope to return and join         the
  group soon.  Let's get to the games...          Corsairs                   This
  is a simple, fun, pirate-theme game with a bit of luck and a bit of strategy.          Not
  for deep thinking, but a solid opener.  It is hard (for me) to resist any         game
  with a pirate theme, and this was no exception for me - I bought a copy of the         game
  from WizKids.  The game is for 2-4 players, and each player is trying to         gain
  the most victory points by boarding galleys.  Galleys have victory points         commensurate
  with the difficulty of capture - based on the number of cards necessary         to
  attempt a board or the die roll necessary to successfully complete a board.          Player
  interaction comes in the form of broadsides, where one player can fire on another
  \        and steal or destroy their cards (provisions), or counter attacks, where
  a player         can try to board a galley after another player by beating his or
  her roll.          Apples to Apples                   The largest game of Apples
  to Apples for me so far - at least 12 folks joined in for         two games.  Fun
  stuff, but I was ready to move on the meatier stuff.          Puerto Rico                   My
  second play of this fantastic game - there were 4 of us, 1 veteran, me (played         once),
  and 2 newbies.  I went for a corn strategy but couldn't get enough to         make
  a difference, and made one bad tactical move during the Captain phase and shipped
  \        the wrong good.  I probably would have still finished second, but would
  have         been much closer to the ultimate winner (the veteran).  I hope to play
  this again         this coming weekend when I host some gaming down in Sherwood.
  \         Piratenbucht                   Another pirate game - arggh.  This is better
  than Corsairs, in my opinion - more         tension and player interaction, and
  more strategy since you can customize your ship.          I've ordered this from
  Funagain and         can't wait to give it a try with my kids.      "

<p>I enjoyed a fun night of gaming last week while visiting Bellevue/Redmond.<br />
There's a group that meets weekly on Tuesdays at the <a href="http://store.wizkidsgames.com/">WizKids<br />
Storefront</a> in Redmond, so I headed up from<br />
Portland a little early to join in on the fun. Fantastic group of people -<br />
very welcoming and I hope to return and join the group soon. Let's get to the<br />
games...</p>
<h3>Corsairs</h3>
<p>This is a simple, fun, pirate-theme game with a bit of luck and a bit of<br />
strategy. Not for deep thinking, but a solid opener. It is hard (for me) to<br />
resist any game with a pirate theme, and this was no exception for me - I<br />
bought a copy of the game from WizKids. The game is for 2-4 players, and each<br />
player is trying to gain the most victory points by boarding galleys. Galleys<br />
have victory points commensurate with the difficulty of capture - based on the<br />
number of cards necessary to attempt a board or the die roll necessary to<br />
successfully complete a board. Player interaction comes in the form of<br />
broadsides, where one player can fire on another and steal or destroy their<br />
cards (provisions), or counter attacks, where a player can try to board a<br />
galley after another player by beating his or her roll.</p>
<h3>Apples to Apples</h3>
<p>The largest game of Apples to Apples for me so far - at least 12 folks joined<br />
in for two games. Fun stuff, but I was ready to move on the meatier stuff.</p>
<h3>Puerto Rico</h3>
<p>My second play of this fantastic game - there were 4 of us, 1 veteran, me<br />
(played once), and 2 newbies. I went for a corn strategy but couldn't get<br />
enough to make a difference, and made one bad tactical move during the Captain<br />
phase and shipped the wrong good. I probably would have still finished second,<br />
but would have been much closer to the ultimate winner (the veteran). I hope<br />
to play this again this coming weekend when I host some gaming down in<br />
Sherwood.</p>
<h3>Piratenbucht</h3>
<p>Another pirate game - arggh. This is better than Corsairs, in my opinion -<br />

your ship. I've ordered this from <a href="http://www.funagain.com">Funagain</a> and can't wait to give it a try with my kids.</p>
