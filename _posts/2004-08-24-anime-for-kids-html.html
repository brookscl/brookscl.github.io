excerpt: So my kids, particularly Matthew, love Anime movies.  They haven't seen very
  many, but they've really enjoyed classics like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away,
  Kiki's Delivery Service, and My Neighbor Totoro. At GenCon last week there were
  a number of Anime DVD vendors present, but I never got a chance to talk to someone
  about recommendations for kids.  Any help out there?  Are there good sites out there
  that provide reviews and content recommendations for Anime?  Any recommendations
  of specific titles?
