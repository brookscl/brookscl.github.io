<p>I've been contributing to <a href="https://standardebooks.org">Standard Ebooks</a> over the past month or so, working on my first publication as a producer. A bit more about Standard Ebooks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Standard Ebooks is a volunteer driven, not-for-profit project that produces lovingly formatted, open source, and free public domain ebooks.<br />
Ebook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style guide, lightly modernizes them, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to take advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology.<br />
Standard Ebooks aren’t just a beautiful addition to your digital library—they’re a high quality standard to build your own ebooks on.</p></blockquote>
<p>My first book is <em><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse/something-new">Something New</a></em> by P.G. Wodehouse. Producing it was enjoyable, tedious at times, and very rewarding. Reading the book was fun too – it is a short, humorous novel and if you are a Downton Abbey fan you'll love the book.</p>
