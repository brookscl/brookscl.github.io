<h2 id="whatimreading">What I&#8217;m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2PAbmII">Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</a> &#8211; finally got around to reading this one. I&#8217;m not sure how it holds up these days (scientifically) but offered interesting ideas, such as the latitudinal axis of Europe-Asia promoting technology propagation along similar climate zones (as opposed to the longitudinal axis of Africa and the Americas).</li>
<li>I had high hopes for <a href="https://amzn.to/2PybJDS">The City of Brass)</a> but it fell off for me about halfway through. Too much court intrigue and plot meandering. Plus I had a hard time keeping the factions and tribe names straight.</li>
<li>I listened to <a href="https://amzn.to/2C7tt5v">This Naked Mind</a> and it may literally be life altering for me. Not ready to say more than that yet.</li>
<li>I casually worked my way through <a href="https://amzn.to/2UCXD7P">My Morning Routine: How Successful People Start Every Day Inspired</a> and got plenty of value from it. A good fit with my workflow tuning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I&#8217;m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/31958307">18CZ</a> with my regular three-player gaming team of Greg and Matt. A good entry in the 18xx pantheon.</li>
<li>While in Florida I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32162688">Ninety-Nine</a> with my mom and Julie. Still the best 3-player trick taking game out there.</li>
<li>Matthew arrived in Florida so we switched over to <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32164411">Spades</a> and had a blast with this team trick playing game.</li>
<li>Julie and I got <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32190181">Sushi Go!</a><br />
9390) for our nephew and taught and played it. I can see now why it is so highly regarded.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve started a regular game night with another couple and played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32286499">Ticket to Ride: Märklin</a> a couple of weeks ago. Julie smoked us with some awesome passenger runs.</li>
<li>My three-player group met again and played the new 18xx card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32333194">18Lilliput</a>. I think this is going to be a big hit and look forward to playing it with family over the winter holiday.</li>
<li>I drove down south before leaving Oregon and played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32389674">Storm Over Dien Bien Phu</a> with Ken. He won.</li>
<li>The new party game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/32473946">Just One</a> arrived here in OKC and we did a first play with family and friends. <strong>Big</strong> hit with gamers and non-gamers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimcooking">What I&#8217;m Cooking</h2>
<ul>
<li>We bought an Instant Pot! I made a <a href="http://www.theedgyveg.com/2018/01/17/mushroom-risotto-instant-pot-recipe/">vegan mushroom risotto</a> and it was awesome. I look forward to exploring this cooking device further.</li>
