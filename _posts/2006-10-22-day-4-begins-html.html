excerpt: I managed to be just inside the main entrance in hall 12 (I forgot the cash
  box key in the hotel room) when the fair opened today - wow, what a crazy scene.
  People sprinting to demo tables to get a spot to try a new game. Weather has been
  great, with only one day of rain and mild temperatures. Just sold our first copy
  of 24/7 today - woot!
