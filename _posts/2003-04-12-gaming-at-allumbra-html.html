<p>Benjamin Corliss has designed two abstract strategy games that he runs online<br />
at his <a href="http://www.allumbra.com">web site</a>. I've only played<br />
<a href="http://www.allumbra.com/games/breacan/rules.jsp">Breacan</a> so far (against<br />
Benjamin), but I like what I see. Check out the site, sign up, and give it a<br />
try.</p>
