excerpt: 'KC, Rita, and I ran two playtest sessions here in Portland in November. 
  Our goal was to get feedback on four of KC''s designs and narrow down a list of
  publishing possibilities.  We had a great turnout, solid participation and feedback,
  and we now feel ready to move to the next step with one or two games, which is blind
  playtesting.  The following is a photo journal of the two playtest events. The Events         The
  first event, held on November 6, was at the Midland Library on Portland''s east
  side. This is a fantastic location for gaming and we plan on using it quarterly
  with our regular gaming group.  The event was from 10am - 6pm and we had 12 playtesters
  attend.  The second event, held on November 13, was held at my home with about the
  same number attending.         The day was fairly structured, divided into four
  sessions with KC teaching the game followed by a play of the game.  Each player
  would then fill out a feedback form on the game.  KC and I would stroll around jotting
  down notes on suggestions and complaints mid-game. Pizzza         Pizzza was the
  first game tested each event.  This is a lighter family game where players have
  secret recipes and try to build pizzas that maximize the scores of their secret
  ingredients.         We made some changes to the board layout before the second
  week, putting the ingredient scoring tracks closer to their respective pizzas. Havoc:
  The Hundred Years'' War         Havoc is the most strategic of the four games, and
  my personal favorite. This is a poker/rummy style card game where players fight
  in a series of battles. Strategy comes into play as players decide what battles
  to fight and what battles to avoid.          We tweaked the rules for the Dogs a
  bit in the second week of testing as they seemed a bit too powerful.  Dogs, which
  are wild-colored zero rank cards, allow players to take cards back from the battlefield
  after a battle is resolved. Northwest Trek         Northwest Trek is a tile-laying
  game where players try and collect snapshots of animals in a nature park.  The original
  version of this game uses Cairo tiles, which creates a very distinct geometry but
  can create some confusion when orienting tiles for placement.         Ever the adjuster,
  KC made some more tweaks for week 2 and tried an offset square-tile version of NW
  Trek which rated much higher relative to the other games than in the prior week.
  Tres Amigos         Tres Amigos is the lightest of the four games - a trick-taking
  game with some similarities to euchre.  The game is a blast to play for those that
  like games in this genre.         There was a great finish to one of the games in
  week 2 - the last hand was played with at least three players in striking distance
  of a victory.'
