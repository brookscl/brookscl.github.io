excerpt: I took a bit of a chance and ordered the game Vanished Planet, a cooperative
  game published independently.  I've heard it is insanely difficult to win, but the
  mechanics and theme looked interesting enough to give it a try.  Hopefully I'll
  get a chance to try it this weekend, and I'll certainly report back when I do.
