excerpt: Board games have been coming out a lot at home so far this year.  Last weekend,
  we brought out Age of Mythology again.  One of my goals in playing the bigger wargame-like
  board games with the boys is to get them to start comprehending strategy.  Not specific
  strategies, but rather just the notion of having some long-term goals, and devising
  some short-term plans to achieve those goals.  All too often in these games they
  just start attacking without thinking about the consequences.  In three player games
  this can be a major weakness, because often the player who avoids conflict will
  come out on top.        Matthew snaps a photo mid-game during Age of Mythology. 
  Matthew played the Egyptions, Jacob the Greeks, and I was the Norse. Jacob, at least,
  is starting to grasp the concept.  There was much less fighting in this game, and
  he set out to try and build the wonder by the end of the game.  I opted for my usual
  strategy of building the most buildings and largest army (mostly by not fighting
  very much).  This was the closest game to date - Jacob finished with the largest
  army and came close to building the wonder at the end.  If I hadn't converted favor
  into victory points late in the game, forcing it to end a bit earlier, Jacob would
  have caught me and won the game. We were given Metro by some friends for Christmas
  and it quickly became a favorite of Julie and Jacob.  This is the sort of game they
  will bring out after school when I'm not even around - that's how I know it's a
  favorite!        Julie plans her domination in Metro.  Her score wrapped around
  the scoring track setting a new house record. This is a fun, quick, light game that
  I simply have not figured out.  I've come in last or second to last every time I've
  played, and have never been in contention.  Maybe I just think too much.  Jacob's
  strategy of ignoring all but 1 or 2 of his lines, and striving to maximize those
  seems to work pretty well.
