<p>Julie and I took an early morning walk on Saturday morning at the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/tualatinriver/">Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge</a> to test out my new Canon 300mm f/4 lens with a 1.4x optical extender.  My plan is for this to be my primary bird-shooting rig when we go to Galapagos next month.  The morning was crisp and clear and I think I came away with some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/sets/72157626097812700/">nice photographs</a> .</p>

<p>This refuge is primarily known for its wetlands and water birds, but in the winter months it is difficult getting close enough to the water fowl for decent shots. Fortunately there were plenty of other birds active - warblers, chickadees, nuthatches, and more.</p>

<p>Woodpeckers are abundant in Oregon - this one was at the top of a tall tree and is about the distance limit with this setup.</p>

<p>As an aside, I appreciate commentary and corrections to my identifications!</p>
