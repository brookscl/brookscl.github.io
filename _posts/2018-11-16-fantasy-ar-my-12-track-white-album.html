<p>I’m a regular listener to the <a href="https://uproxx.com/topic/celebration-rock-podcast/">Celebration Rock podcast</a>, and a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Hyden">Steven Hyden’s</a> writing. Their latest episode presented a fun what-if exercise: what if you were the A&amp;R person responsible for cutting the Beatles’ white album down to just 12 tracks for popular consumption? Steven Hyden invited Rob Mitchum to make a track list, as well as modify the order. I made my own list before listening to theirs and it was a fun exercise.</p>
<h2 id="sidea">Side A</h2>
<ol>
<li>Back in the USSR – To me it is not the white album without this opening song, though I understand others might throw away this song as another McCartney excursion. Doesn’t hurt that I’m also a big Beach Boys fan and this song is one of the milestones in the <a href="http://www.beatlesebooks.com/back-in-the-ussr">interplay between the two bands</a>.</li>
<li>Dear Prudence – In my all-time top 5 list of Beatles songs, this one must come right after <em>Back in the USSR</em>. This is my all-time favorite Lennon song, and possibly one of the last true collaborations with Paul (<a href="https://www.notreble.com/buzz/2013/09/13/the-beatles-dear-prudence-paul-mccartneys-isolated-bass/">check out the isolated bass track</a>).</li>
<li>Glass Onion – Gotta include the meta-song.</li>
<li>Rocky Raccoon – I struggled with this one, and in hindsight I wonder if I should have included <em>Martha My Dear</em> instead.</li>
<li>While My Guitar Gently Weeps – Epic George Harrison, though including this without <em>Bungalow Bill</em> leading into shows just how hard it is to pull out single tracks.</li>
<li>Helter Skelter – Let’s close side A with one of the best rockers The Beatles ever made.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sideb">Side B</h2>
<ol>
<li>Blackbird – Side B is a bit mellower and kicks off with this example of McCartney poetry.</li>
<li>I’m So Tired – Lennon’s cry out to the world about the impending doom that is The Beatles.</li>
<li>Happiness is a Warm Gun – I tend towards the straight-line pop from the Beatles; this is an exception.</li>
<li>Mother Nature’s Son – Love this McCartney song, and I also love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpGCVc-oMfY">Sheryl Crow’s cover</a>.</li>
<li>Savoy Truffle – Definitely the last pick that made the list. If the rocker version of <em>Revolution</em> had been on the white album it would take this song’s place.</li>
<li>Julia – John at his mellow-ist, singing to his mother (and Yoko?).</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the playlist on Spotify:</p>
