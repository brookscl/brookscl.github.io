excerpt: Let's see, where was I... Have I mentioned that work has been pretty busy
  lately?  I'm at the point where I almost feel guilty taking any time to write entries
  even when I do have a moment to relax and take a breath.  It is therapeutic though
  and I really should make the time. Getting back to the gaming weekend out at Salishan,
  I was last talking about the gaming up until Doug arrived on Friday afternoon. 
  I wasn't expecting him until the evening and it was a pleasant surprise to see an
  email from him Friday morning that he would arrive early. Dave and I were playing
  the Game of Thrones CCG when Doug arrived (Jacob was reading).  Doug talked Jacob
  into a game of Yinsh (or vice versa), a game my kids have been playing quite a bit
  lately.         Doug, Jacob, Yinsh. For those of you not familiar with Yinsh, it
  is part of the Gipf series of two player abstract games.  I own Yinsh but haven't
  even played it yet.  I have played Dvonn quite a bit and love it; Yinsh looks even
  more interesting to me.  All of the games of Yinsh I've seen tend to be close with
  quite a bit of tension - it seems like a game where you can come from behind and
  win.  Dvonn, on the other hand, often feels like it is over halfway through the
  game. Time for a four-player game.  Doug and I were very interested in breaking
  out another scenario from the Settlers of Catan Book; we opted for a rematch of
  The Great Race, a scenario we played out at Sun River last year.         Setting
  up the board for Das Grosse Renen. The only goal in the game is to be the first
  to cross the board and build a city near one of the gold mines - victory points
  are for sissies!  The exploration process was quite humorous, with Doug and I discovering
  most of the unknown territories.  Doug had a knack for discovering more seas, while
  the first two lands I discovered were (1) redundant with lands on which I already
  had settlements, and (2) well equipped with the number 12 for my resource-producing
  pleasure.         Hey, 12s may be uncommon but I'll be rolling in it when they do
  come up! I made Doug, Dave, and Jacob promise to do the chicken dance each time
  a 12 came up thereafter.  They got to entertain me just once the rest of the game. 
  I shouldn't be too bitter though, as I managed to win the game due to an excessive
  production of sheep at the end of the game (plus a sheep port). At this point Mike
  and George arrived, and Dave brought out Dawn Under, a purchase he made during a
  stop at Rainy Day Games on our way out to the coast.  This is, ugh, a memory game
  that has something to do with vampires, coffins, graves.  It is a nice looking game
  that would probably appeal to families if it weren't for the theme (though the vampires
  are quite cutsie).         Yes, Doug, I too wanted to drive a stake through this
  game. George was then eager to try a new dice game he picked up called Sharp Shooters. 
  We were all a bit skeptical on this one and gave him a hard time, but in the end
  I think it was better than any of us expected.  Think of it like a game of Yahtzee
  where players share dice.  There's some strategy in timing as you want to avoid
  setting up your opponents for scoring opportunities, but you still need to push
  your luck a bit to score.  I'd play it again and I'm certain my kids would like
  it.         George getting the dice and chips ready for Sharp Shooters.
