excerpt: Jacob and I traveled across town to the Rude household for some Sunday afternoon
  gaming yesterday.  Matthew had a birthday party to attend, so it was a good chance
  to play some heavier four-player games. New Eden I've written about New Eden before
  - this is the prototype developed by KC Humphrey.  I'm going to be demonstrating
  the game for some folks later this week, so I wanted to brush up on my knowledge
  of the rules and practice teaching it to a group.  Ken, Brandon, and Jacob had not
  played yet, so this was a perfect opportunity.  I have described the mechanics of
  the game before, so I won't repeat any of those details here.        Brandon, Ken,
  and Jacob plot their moves in New Eden. We had limited time for this game, so we
  only played one season (a normal game has two seasons, with a scoring round after
  each).  I found that I had remembered the rules well and didn't have to reference
  the rulebook very frequuently.  We used the small board configuration for four players,
  and started with half the fuel supply (21, though after talking with KC it should
  have been only 20). The group enjoyed the game very much.  The end of the game found
  everyone thinking about strategies, how to take advantage of certain card combinations,
  etc. which is a very good sign.  I mostly avoided conflict and got three uncontested
  farms near a lake, but Brandon turned out to be the smarter player and finished
  with three more points than I, taking first place.        Final positions after
  one season. Amun Re Ken was eager to bring out Amun Re, as was I, so that was our
  next choice.  Every time I play this game I enjoy it more.  Unfortunately, this
  time I had a similar result as the last time I played this game - very strong start
  in the old age, poor finish in the new age.        Brandon, Ken, and Jacob take
  their actions in Amun Re. I exhausted my funds at the end of the old age via sacrifice,
  trying to maximize the scoring of my two temples.  I also drew no bonus power cards
  in the new age (I was able to score two of them in the old age, so I guess it evened
  out).        Final positions in Amun Re.  Brandon finished seven points ahead of
  the closest finisher (me), mostly by virtue of his temples that score their maximum
  potential. Brandon played a very strong game again, quietly gaining two temples,
  one bonus power card, and a temple majority on one side of the Nile.  He finished
  far out in front, beating me out by seven points. El Grande There wasn't much time
  left, but I was eager to teach the group how to play El Grande and at least get
  in a few rounds before taking Jacob home.  I really love this game (I've only played
  it 1.5 times though).  Very easy to teach and learn, beautiful components (perhaps
  the nicest I've ever seen in a board game), but challenging to play well.        Brandon
  and Jacob stare each other down over Spain in El Grande. We only played through
  the first scoring round, but Brandon completed his trifecta, showing up the adults
  one more time with a victory.  His victory was sealed when Jacob, Ken, and I all
  chose the same province for our Castille caballeros!

<h3>New Eden</h3>
