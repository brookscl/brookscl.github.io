excerpt: 'This Wednesday I return to Dallas for my fifth BGG.CON, having missed only
  the 2006 event (too much hangover from Essen that year!) (you might enjoy reading
  my posts from prior years: BGG.CON 2005 Wrap-up, BGG.CON 2007 Wrap-up, BGG.CON 2008
  Wrap-up, BGG.CON 2009 Wrap-up). If you check out my games played report for the
  past three months you’ll get a sense of how eager I am to get back in the game.
  I’ve barely been able to stay on top of the new games entering the market, let alone
  have time to play them. Football season is over (at least for my coaching duties)
  and I’m looking forward to an opportunity to re-engage. Jim Ginn and I will be rooming
  together again this year, and I’ve prioritized the games I’m hoping to play this
  weekend. Here goes: Carson City This was a 2009 release that several different people
  have recommended to me. It has role selection in a unique setting with what appears
  to be heavy player interaction. From what I’ve seen the 2nd edition English version
  is quite nice to look at as well. Cyclades Looks like a fun multiplayer wargame
  with some Euro and American influences. The Greek gods theme would play well at
  home with the boys and the bits look very nice. Endeavor Looks like a relatively
  simple to learn and play exploration and civ game that could be a nice convention
  fit (pull from library and learn to play on the spot). Yet another 2009 release
  that I haven’t seen yet. Founding Fathers I love the theme, am a fan of card driven
  games, and Jason Matthews has yet to let me down. Hopefully Jim, Jeff Deboer, and
  I can get in a late-night play of this. Runewars This is probably wishful thinking
  for BGG.CON but I’m still eager to play this game set in the same universe as Runebound
  and Descent. Reviews are very mixed on this game, making it even more important
  to try before I buy. This is a game I’ll only play this weekend if I can find someone
  to teach. Dominant Species The only game on this list that I own (purchased using
  the P500 end of year sale from GMT) but would like to play and learn this at the
  con in hopes of playing with the family this winter. We are taking a family trip
  to Galapagos so some evolution learnin’ is in order. I’ve got the rules (supposedly
  up to the high quality benchmark Chad Jensen set with Combat Commander) on my iPad
  and hopefully will find some willing opponents. I’ve heard Jim is a Darwin fan so
  I suspect I can talk him into playing. Castle Ravenloft Still looking for an immersive
  dungeon crawl that plays well as a game and can be setup and played in 2 hours or
  less. Is this it? I can’t make sense of the reviews on BGG so will take the time
  to try it myself. I think some folks in my game group like it. 7 Wonders This seems
  to be on everyone’s 2010 hit list and looks to be right up my alley. My guess is
  that this will be one of the most played games at this year’s convention. Troyes
  Dice, dice, and more dice. Maybe more Euro than I care for these days but this definitely
  looks worth trying.'
