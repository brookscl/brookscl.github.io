excerpt: 'Sunday after our successful game day, Jacob, Matthew, and I decided to play
  another game of Warcraft: The Boardgame.  The last time I played a three player
  game, we used the standard scenario out of the rules.  This time we downloaded and
  played the Orcs for Sale! scenario published at the FFG website by the game''s original
  designer Kevin Wilson. This scenario has a fairly symetric layout and a standard
  victory point-based objective for players.  The added twist is the ability to hire
  (fully upgraded) mercenary orcs at mercenary camps (any of the two-point objective
  spaces) for a cost of four gold.  Players play each of the other three races (Night
  Elves, Humans, and Undead).  These Orcs are very powerful and can be obtained early
  in the game.  The one catch is that they must always be accompanied by one of your
  regular units.  If they are ever left alone, they return to the pool of available
  mercenaries.        Jacob and Matthew plot their moves. One key element of every
  Warcraft game I''ve played to date is resource scarcity due to (random) depletion
  of gold mines and forests.  This forces players to rush to the center and claim
  additional resource centers.  Jacob and I pushed to the center, and he decided to
  attack me when we were fairly closely matched.  I urged him to reconsider since
  the only benefactor was likely to be Matthew, but he attacked anyway.  Unfortunately
  for him, the dice went my way and most of his military was devastated.  It can be
  very difficult to come back from a setback like that, and this one battle dropped
  him out of contention for good. I was able to gain control of the center and fight
  of Matthew as he came in.  It was only a matter of time before I was able to grab
  my 12 victory points and win the game.        Near final configuration.  Chris was
  green (Night Elves), Jacob was blue (Human), and Matthew purple (Undead). We still
  enjoy this game, but I''m finding it great on theme but light on strategy.  Similar
  to the computer game, the “rush” strategy seems to payoff and it can often come
  down to who gets luckiest rolling the resource dice.  I''m seriously considering
  some variants on resource depletion to allow for more strategic buildup. One other
  note - we still haven''t played this game by the rules based on some recent postings
  at the Warcraft Yahoo group.  These are fairly major mistakes, so make sure you
  temper my remarks with the clarifications I''m about to give.  We really bungled
  up the player and phase sequence.  There are 4 steps to each turn: Move, Harvest,
  Deploy, and Spend.  We had each player doing all 4 steps in turn.  We were supposed
  to have each player move, then each harvest, etc.  When all 4 steps are completed,
  the starting player rotates to the next clockwise.  I can see this having a huge
  impact on gameplay.  During the spend phase, you are supposed to be able to do only
  one of the following: Train units and works, Construct buildings and outposts, and
  Upgrade a unit type.  In our games we allowed players to do all of these actions
  as long as they had the gold.  This limitation serves to throttle play a bit and
  might help avoid the rush situation I mentioned. Sigh.  I thought I was pretty good
  at reading and interpreting rules, but these were pretty serious misses on my part. 
  I''ll report back after another session where we play by the correct rules.'

<p>Sunday after our successful game day, Jacob, Matthew, and I decided to play<br />
another game of <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/7479">Warcraft: The Boardgame</a>. The <a href="/PermaLink.aspx?guid=15e3f783-e64b-45b5-8c9f-9dd1504c7c21">last time I played a three player game</a>,<br />
