excerpt: Next weekend I'll be spending about 3.5 days in Sunriver with Doug and crowd
  at his "WBC West" event. This will involve mostly wargaming with a little bit of
  lighter fare thrown in at nights. Doug and I will also be seeing Wilco play in Bend
  on Saturday night. Going to an event like this where I'll be playing new (to me)
  wargames requires some preparation. Two games I want to play are Napoleonic Wars
  and FAB:Bulge. At a minimum preparation means setting up the game and working through
  a sample solitaire turn or two, but Jacob's eyes lit up when I suggested we play
  a wargame on Saturday afternoon / evening. He chose Napoleonic Wars and I set out
  to read enough of the rules to get us started. I let Jacob play the French - slightly
  less to manage in a 2 player game as he starts off only controlling France and Spain,
  while the coalition player runs Russia, Great Britain, and Austria.  As expected
  the first few rounds were slow going. A round consists of a series of impulses (usually
  card plays) by each nation in a fixed order. Like many other card-driven games (CDGs),
  the player usually has the choice of activating an event or playing the card for
  operation points which can be used for movement, drafting new troops, and influencing
  diplomatic relations. Jacob turned east from the start, marching Napoleon's army
  towards Austria. I had to respond by gathering Austrian forces and bringing Russian
  troops in to reinforce, ultimately joining the Austrians and Russians together in
  a single army. Meanwhile, the British harassed the French and Spanish in the seas,
  taking control of the Atlantic and Med by the 3rd round or so.  We got sidetracked
  later Saturday evening watching the Olympics and resumed our play on Sunday morning.
  We knew we would get one turn in max after the first turn ended, so when the peace
  phases came up and we had to choose how many cards to give up to influence the die
  roll, I had a choice to make. Jacob was in the lead by one point by virtue of a
  key he took in his last move in Austria and sacrificed a card to add one to the
  peace roll (if a 6 is rolled on a single D6 the game ends). I could have given up
  2 cards from any of the 3 countries I controlled, but opted to give up just a single
  card and let the die roll, knowing we would have to end the game anyway. Of course
  a 6 was rolled and the game ended with Jacob victorious - not a satisfying ending
  but appropriate. We learned enough to get down most of the mechanics and Jacob looks
  forward to another play. I also still need to introduce him to Hannibal.
