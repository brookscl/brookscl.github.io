<p>I first introduced Jacob and Matthew to Dungeons and Dragons towards the end of 2003, and shortly thereafter we started a D&amp;D 3.0 campaign with Ken and Brandon Rude.  I <a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2006/1/17/dungeons-and-dragons-35.html">posted about 5 years ago</a> about our transition from D&amp;D 3.0 to 3.5.</p>

<p>Over time our sessions grew less and less frequent.  We had hoped to conduct a full campaign using Shackled City with the 3.5 ruleset, but a combination of infrequent play and the subsequent release of D&amp;D 4.0 set that aside.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">4th edition was released in 2008</a> and Ken and I independently had opportunities to try out the new system and immediately fell in love.  It simplified the core mechanics and made it feel similar to lighter-weight dungeon crawl board games such as <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17226/descent-journeys-in-the-dark">Descent</a> while retaining the epic campaign feel that keeps us coming back for more.</p>
<p>So... we started all over with a D&amp;D 4th edition campaign, using the wonderful online tools from Wizards to handle character creation and printing.  Unfortunately we stalled out for an entire year - baseball, football, basketball, and drama clubs have a way of taking precedence over activities like this.</p>

<p>We are back in the swing though and got together last weekend for a six hour session.  We are in the midst of the canned adventure <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/217417400">Thunderspire Labyrinth</a> and should finish it with one more long session.  And I'm still using my wookie miniature for D&amp;D!</p>
