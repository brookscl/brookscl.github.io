excerpt: 'Chairman Mike did a fabulous job writing up our recent gaming weekend out
  on the coast, but I still wanted to share some of the impressions of the games I
  played.  There were no stinkers in the entire batch and I had an amazingly fun time.
  Command & Colors: Ancients Mike and I managed to play 3 two-player games before
  anyone else arrived, and this was our first.  I continue to rate this game very
  highly in terms of playability and speed - I haven''t had a game run over an hour
  since my first play.  I continue to have a hard time winning this game, and this
  one proved no exception. Drive One of my favorite 2-player card games.  Mike plays
  faster than anyone I''ve played so far (in terms of laying down sets), so I was
  forced to adjust a bit and managed two have a huge scoring second round.  This put
  me well out of reach in the third and I won easily.  I think this was one of only 3
  wins for me all weekend, but who''s counting? Combat Commander: Europe We played
  a fairly bizarre scenario (#7?) with a randomized setup for the Russian player followed
  by a clustered setup by the German.  This allowed me to position myself to cut off
  one of Mike''s leaders and it was downhill most of the game for him from there. 
  It didn''t hurt that I was able to bring in a crack paratroop squad to steal a couple
  of control points on the other side of the board.  This is still my favorite game
  of the year and I''ll be anxiously awaiting the first expansion soon I expect. Mermaid
  Rain Doug and Mimi taught this to me and I quite liked it.  It had an Elfenland
  / King of the Elves feel to me with a few nice twists (such as card play similar
  to Havoc).   Bohnanza Julie and I are expecting to try this at the end of the game
  class we are teaching (it concludes just before spring break at the end of March)
  so I wanted to try this again.  What a blast - I did poorly, but this is a great
  game that I need to play more often.  I''m very concerned about teaching 3-5 graders
  the game and playing it within 50 minutes.  I wonder if there are any simplified
  rules out there? Mykerinos This game has been on my hope-to-try list for quite some
  time and I enjoyed it.  Felt very much like a lighter version of Ys and I can see
  some real depth to the game.  I''m fairly certain Matt won this one. Canal Mania
  (x2) The hit of the weekend for me, coming out twice with 5 players.  The game is
  taking about 2 hours to play, which is a bit long.  There''s also enough downtime
  in the game to do 3 loads of laundry during two hours (trust me, I know...) so I
  think I''ll prefer it with 3 players in the long run.  I think with three experienced
  players we can get the time down to 1 hour.  I did OK in both games, finishing about
  in the middle but very much in the running during the second game.  I''m glad that
  the second edition is going to balance the benefits of construction and running
  goods, as I think there''s way too much opportunity to get imbalanced scoring on
  goods as it is (especially if players aren''t paying attention when putting goods
  out). 18TN This was by far the longest game I played over the weekend, and while
  it was fun I didn''t have the same great feeling as I did after 18FL and 1850 (maybe
  because I finished dead last?). I think Mimi was somewhat reluctant to play, but
  she played fabulously and beat us all.  I was too tied into my major line and didn''t
  get enough participation in some other quality rails. Power Grid - Easter Europe
  Power Grid is a game I still love but I''m just not very good at.  The Eastern Europe
  map is quite different than most - very cheap raw goods but expensive connections.
  Liberte Man, what a great game with miserable components.  I''d love to do a rework
  of the graphical elements on this game and make it playable.  I think I''m going
  to take a sharpie to the board and cards to make the regions distinguishable.  Ken
  Crangle informed me later that we played wrong in a big way - one of the cards (Terror?)
  requires that the red faction be in charge in order to play, and we missed this. 
  Boy, did we have a pile of generals'' heads built up in the game box!  Our last
  2 battles went without a winner as a result, so this was a pretty broken game. 
  Still fun though. Agon Saturday night I ran a quick session of Agon, an indie RPG
  set in Greek mythology.  I stumbled a bit with the system and made a few mistakes
  (this was my first play), but I think everyone had a good time.  Wes is a very experience
  role-player and did a great job as a player, adding good color text and helping
  prop me up when I struggled. Die Säulen der Erde Sunday after lunch Ken, Mike and
  I played this Essen release.  I only played 1 turn of the game at Essen, standing
  in for Jim Ginn as he had to run off in the middle of game.  So, I had a basic idea
  of the mechanics but no sense of strategy.  Mike maintained a solid lead throughout
  the game, but I think I had a decent understanding of the economic system at play
  and made mostly good moves.  Ken adopted a strategy of converting gold into victory
  points, and I''m not sure that''s a winnable approach (though I''m glad he tried
  - it was interesting seeing the economics).  I think I''ll want to buy this one
  when Mayfair ships the English version in a month or two.'
