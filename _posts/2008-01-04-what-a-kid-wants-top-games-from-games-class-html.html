excerpt: I ran my weekly Game On! games class for 3-5 graders again this fall and
  had a great time; I think the kids did too.  I surveyed 22 of the kids at the end
  of the class and had them rank their top 3 games in order.  Every game got at least
  a few votes, so that's a good sign that I'm bringing games that kids want to play. 
  The table below shows the final ranking, with the score based on 3 points for 1st,
  2 points for 2nd, 1 point for 3rd.  I also show the total number of kids voting
  for that particular game - pretty amazing that 20 of the 22 kids had Incan Gold
  on their top 3 list.    Game Score Total Votes  Incan Gold 50 20  Saboteur 27 14  Tsuro
  14 9  Hey! That's My Fish 13 8  Walk the Dogs 11 5  TransEuropa 9 5  Slide 5 (aka
  6 Nimmt) 8 5 We didn't get a chance to play Werewolf this year - I suspect it would
  have given Incan Gold a run for its money.  I thought Slide 5 would do better, but
  the game is a bit dry and subtle for the elementary school crowd in my opinion. 
  Incan Gold and Saboteur are very thematic and interactive and are sure hits in family
  and kid settings.
