excerpt: I gave the new version of Puerto Rico Online a try last night.  Overall I
  was very impressed.  The interface isn't great, but is still much better than the
  one at BSW.  What I like the most about it is how quickly I was able to get online
  and jump into a game.  This is because this version supports computer AI players. 
  Oddly enough, and I could be wrong here but I'm pretty sure I saw this happen, human
  players can join in after a game has started and replace a computer player.  The
  AI appears to be fairly weak, but I suspect it will improve over time.
