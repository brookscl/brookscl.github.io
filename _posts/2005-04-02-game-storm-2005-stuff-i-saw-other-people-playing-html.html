excerpt: ' Here is where I''ll post a photo journal with minimal commentary on other
  games I saw folks playing at Game Storm.  I hung out almost exclusively in the board
  game and RPGA areas, so you won''t see much in the way of miniatures or CCG games.          This
  game of Age of Renaissance lasted nearly all day.          Attika - one of my favorites
  from 2004.          This was the first time I had seen the new Eagle Games release
  Blood Feud in New York.  Cool bits but I don''t know much about the game play.          Doug
  anxiously awaits the start of a Manifest Destiny game.  Wish I could have joined
  him.          This looked interesting - Escape from Colditz.  This game is over
  30 years old.          This was the "other" Gettysburg game going on. The map scale
  was extremely fine-grained and there were hundreds of cardboard counters involved.          Doug,
  Mimi, and others enjoy a game of Manifest Destiny.          Doug, Mimi, and others
  play Pirate''s Cove.          There were three different Power Grid games happening
  simulatenously.          George teaches Doug and one other the highly regarded Revolution:
  the Dutch Revolt.  George is Dutch.          One of my top 3 of 2005 - St. Petersburg.          Ahh,
  the Knizia classic Tigris and Euphrates.          There were a few Wizard Kings
  games going on over the weekend.  I haven''t tried this one yet.'
