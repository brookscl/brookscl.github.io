excerpt: I will be heading to GameStorm after work (actually a bit early so that I
  can deliver a copy of KC's New Eden prototype to him in time for his session) today
  for some gaming goodness.  I plan to stay this evening, and may attend tomorrow
  night as well.  Dave Eggleston is hosting a late-night A Game of Thrones session
  that I'm very tempted to join if there is room. On Sunday morning I will be running
  a three hour session where I will be demonstrating the latest batch of Uberplay
  games, including Oasis (to be renamed Desert Oasis), Hoity Toity, Tongiaki, and
  Relationship Tightrope.  These are all very solid games and I spent the week learning
  the rules, playing with the family, etc. to become acquainted.  I'll post reports
  over the weekend as things progress.
