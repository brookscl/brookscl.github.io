excerpt: Jacob and Matthew had their end-of-year piano recital on Saturday.  They
  both did very well, and given that they enjoy it so much (and therefore practice)
  we plan to continue their lessons next year.         The boys closed out their recital
  with a short ensemble piece.  Their teacher is shown guiding their performance.
