excerpt: Jacob and I cruised over to Kevin's last weekend for some Sunday gaming.
  Normally a long haul for us, it was very convenient this time because Jacob and
  I were able to get in some Christmas shopping for Julie and Matthew at the nearby
  shopping malls.  Jacob spent his own money on his gift for Matthew and was a great
  helper while we found a few items for Julie. Kevin always has such a friendly crowd
  at his place, and the group is usually a good, manageable size (6-9 people).  Onto
  the games... Condottierie As the 'geek likes to say, this is a “card game that's
  masquerading as a board game” - a fun opener that almost always seems to end too
  quickly for me.  I'm sure this is partly because each game has been played with
  1 or 2 first timers.  Players play cards to participate in an auction for provinces
  with a goal of owning three contiguous.  Most of the cards have face values, while
  a some can be played to double a player's bid, force each of the facecards to be
  worth only 1, or force an auction to end early.  Jacob set up the winning play this
  game by contesting a province adjacent to his that would give Kevin enough contiguous
  provinces to win the game.        Jacob, Kevin, Sabrina, Jim, and Chris play Condottiere.
  Unfortunately not enough strength stayed in the hand, and I wound up 1 or 2 points
  short of Kevin's total (he had few but sufficient cards) and he won the game. MedinaThis game
  will soon hold the record for game I've seen played the most without ever playing
  it.  This looks fun - the bits are so cool and I haven't played many building games
  like this.         Kevin, Jeff, and Jim play Medina.          The game board. Gotta
  love those wooden pieces. Domaine Ahhh, Domaine... this one I've been wanting to
  try for some time.  Jacob and I saw a large format version of this at GenCon last
  summer, and since that time it has been on our short list of games to try.  So when
  the opportunity to play it came up, Jacob and I snatched the box and Sabrina joined
  us. Domaine is a very spatial game (you can read an online tutorial).  There is
  a random layout in each game with the 9 land tiles (a fixed center), and players
  alternate placing each of their four castles on the board with an adjacent knight. 
  There are some special squares on the board - some help produce victory points (villages
  and forests), others produce income (mines), and then there are the meadows which
  are essentially empty space.  The goal of the game is to segment off chunks of the
  game board with borders, creating domains around your castles.        Domaine game
  board, shortly after initial setup. If you try and get too greedy and build a huge
  domain, it will either take too long or your opponent will just disrupt your plans. 
  Economy enters the game as players must pay gold to perform actions, which include
  training knights, building borders, or expanding an existing domain into an opponent's. 
  The card deck composition is creative - cards are labeled A, B, C, and D, and all
  of the “A” cards are shuffled together, then the B's, etc.  The A's are placed on
  top of the B's, B's on the C's, and the C's on the D's.  This creates a changing
  economic environment in the game.  For example, action cards to build borders are
  more common early in the game and often cost less than later in the game. The easiest
  way of getting money is selling your action cards - they have a sale price as well
  as an action cost (the selling price is always less than the cost).  Cards that
  you sell back to the bank go face up in a pool of cards that your opponents can
  then purchase back. We made a few serious rules blunders during play (I was teaching
  Sabrina and Jacob how to play while I taught myself), the most serious being how
  knights are handled.  Nobody was building knights early on because we missed the
  rule that said you can only expand into someone else's domain if you have more knights
  in the expanding domain than in the opponent's.  This is obviously a critical reason
  to recruit knights, and without this understanding it doesn't make much sense to
  ever hire a new one.  We pointed out to Kevin how worthless the knights seemed,
  and he quickly corrected us.  This came just as the domains were getting completed,
  so there ensued a rush to build knights.  We also missed the rule that you can't
  steal a knight adjacent to a castle (hence the configuration you'll see below in
  the end game). I held a fairly healthy lead for a while, but Jacob and Sabrina came
  on strong as they began to complete their domains.  I pulled out the victory by
  expanding a domain and grabbing a resource monopoly at the end which pushed me slightly
  ahead in victory points (I was orange, Jacob blue, and Sabrina red).  This game
  is on my short to-buy list - after the holidays though (hey, it's Christmas - we
  shouldn't be buying stuff for ourselves!).        Domaine final configuration. Can
  you spot the illegal domain? Clans Kevin, Jim, Jeff, and Sabrina then played a game
  of Clans.  This is most definitely not on my to-buy list.  This is an abstract game
  with a fairly weak theme, and my one playing with Angela wasn't very enjoyable. 
  Maybe I should give it another try... but really, why, when there are some many
  games I like out there?        Kevin teaches Clans. Aladdin's Dragons A new guest
  arrived that I hadn't met before - welcome Greg!  Greg is an experienced gamer but
  hadn't tried Aladdin's Dragons yet, so I offered to teach it to Greg and Jacob. 
  I enjoy this game and will rarely turn down an opportunity to play it.  This game
  is an auction game with a few magical twists (artifacts and spell cards that can
  be used to disrupt auctions or alter the game mechanics).  Each player has a series
  of tokens numbered from 1 to 9 (minus the 3), and players take turns bidding face
  down with the tokens on a number of spaces (caverns where you can get gems, the
  town where you can get cards and other advantages, and the palace where you can
  get artifacts).  The player with the most artifacts wins the game.  The basic strategy
  is to acquire gems early on so that you can by artifacts as the game progresses. 
  This game is always pretty close when I play it, and this was no exception.  I managed
  to pull out the victory with one more tile than Greg, and two more than Jacob.        Greg,
  Jacob, and Chris play Aladdin's Dragons.Well, that was it for this session (for
  Jacob and I anyway - it was getting late and Jacob had school on Monday).  Stand
  by for another session report - we had a game day it our house yesterday with a
  huge turnout and a number of interesting games played.
