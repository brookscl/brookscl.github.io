<blockquote><p>With all those preparations in progress, I hope you’re ready, because there’s a recession on the way.</p>
<p>I can say this with confidence because there’s always a recession coming – we just never know exactly when. About the only thing I can guarantee is that we are about four years closer to the next recession than we were when I wrote that optimistic earlier article.</p></blockquote>
