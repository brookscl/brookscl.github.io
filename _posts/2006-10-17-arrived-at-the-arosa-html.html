excerpt: 'We made it safe and sound to the Arosa in two taxis. It is almost fortunate
  that three of our bags didn''t make it (they are held up in Frankfurt and will arrive
  later today) as we wouldn''t have fit in two cabs.   The hotel is just as we remember
  from last year with a nice surprise waiting for us in the lobby: three large boxes
  from Ludo Pakt containing our first shipment of 24/7: the Game! I got some choice
  photos of Carey unpacking and opening the first box - we are very pleased with the
  quality and everyone was able to breathe a huge sigh of relief (what do you do if
  the games don''t show up?).   After unpacking it is off to the Messe to check out
  our digs, make sure the furniture arrived, and start setting up the booth.'
