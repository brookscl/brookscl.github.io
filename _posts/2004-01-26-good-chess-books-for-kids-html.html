excerpt: 'Every once in a while I get asked what chess books for kids would I recommend. 
  I haven''t read too many, but here are a few recommendations:  Starting Chess, by
  Harriet Castor. Checkmate at Chess City, by Piers Harper. This one is especially
  good if your child enjoys puzzles. Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess, by Bobby Fischer. 
  This is not a good book to learn chess from, but a great way to improve skills. 
  Jacob just read this cover to cover and enjoyed working through the puzzles.'
