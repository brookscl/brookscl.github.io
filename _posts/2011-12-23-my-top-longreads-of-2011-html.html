<p>I've written before about <a href="/blog/2011/6/21/long-reads-and-instapaper.html">Instapaper and longreads</a> and my reading habits haven't changed.  I love <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/" title="Instapaper: Save interesting web pages for reading later">Instapaper</a> still and strongly recommend it to anyone interested in reading more than just USA Today soundbites.  Now is the time of year when everyone <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=top+longreads+2011">is putting out their top longreads of the year</a> so I figured I would share mine:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.historynet.com/churchill-imagines-how-the-south-won-the-civil-war.htm/1">Churchill Imagines How the South Won the Civil War</a> -- I love the long articles over on HISTORYnet.
