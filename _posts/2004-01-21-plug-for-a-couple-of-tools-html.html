excerpt: '     I don''t write about technology too much in this forum, but every once
  in a while I     like to plug some cool toys or tools that I find useful.       First,
  have a look at Plaxo.  The company     was founded by Sean Parker, one of the original
  Napster guys.  If you have problems     keeping your electronic address book up
  to date, and you want to make sure the people     in your address book are notified
  automatically when your contact info changes, then     this is the tool for you.       Second,
  I''ve been using a trial version of TaskLine this     week, and I''m getting pretty
  close to making a purchase.  My calendar at work     tends to get co-opted by meetings
  scheduled by other people, only some of which are     worth my time.  Most days,
  there''s little time left over to do real work.      TaskLine will take the tasks
  you enter in Outlook (you must provide work estimates     with your tasks, e.g.,
  "Call Bob" will take 15 minutes) and TaskLine will conveniently     fill in your
  calendar with the task items.  It also gives a tremendous amount     of control
  to the user over how it operates.  Why didn''t I think of this? '
