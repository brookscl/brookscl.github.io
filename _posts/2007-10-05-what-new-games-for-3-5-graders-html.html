excerpt: I'm doing the game class thing again at school this year.  Take a look at
  the games I used last year and leave comments here with any new suggestions for
  2007-2008.  Remember, I only have 50 minutes to teach and play the game, so that's
  a significant constraint.  I prefer games that support at least 4 players.
