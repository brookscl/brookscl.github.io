excerpt: "              I was in Providence, RI last week for a business trip, and
  had a few hours after my         meeting before I had to head to the airport.  I
  did a Google search for game         stores near my hotel in downtown Providence,
  and discovered The Gamekeeper (unrelated         to the Hasbro/WOTC/Game Keeper).
  \                  I immediately started talking to the friendly owner, Lawrence
  Whalen, who gave some         good recommendations on games to buy for a friend
  who's birthday was coming up (Age         of Steam and Carcassonne:         Hunters
  and Gatherers).  Walking around his small store, I got a bit curious         since
  I saw a nice computer setup with dual monitors, and I noticed that he was         running
  Adobe Photoshop with some artwork.  Turns out that Lawrence doesn't just         run
  a game shop, he also has a game company: Face         2 Face Games.  Their first
  major project is a re-release of the Sid Sackson         Classic I'm         the
  Boss.  I personally haven't played the original, but it looks like a         good
  family game that might have some mass-market appeal.      "
