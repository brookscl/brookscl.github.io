excerpt: Jacob and I spent our first day at GenCon Indy today, lasting from 8am until
  about 5pm.  Overall the experience was great; I would say better than last year. 
  Organization appears to be better, shorter lines, and generally happy gamers. I
  did hear that people waited in long lines Thursday morning for registration (convention
  and individual events).  Most stories I heard involved waits of about 3 hours. 
  In contrast, those arriving Friday morning waited only about 15 minutes.  Now why
  these people don't just pre-register escapes me.  We even had our badges and event
  tickets mailed out, so there was zero waiting time for us this morning. My entries
  for GenCon this year will be mostly photo-album oriented, but I'll try to break
  things down into a few categories.  If there's anything you'd like me to check out
  Saturday or Sunday, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do. Tomorrow Matthew
  will join us as well.  We'll stay as late as we can stand.  Our morning starts with
  some more Days of Wonder booth time, followed by an introductory session of Big
  Eyes, Small Mouth (Anime RPG). Scheduled Gaming         Jacob and I started the
  morning with an 8am session of giant Seafarers of Catan.  We've played Settlers
  of Catan quite a bit, but had never played a Seafarers scenario.  This was a closely
  contested match, with the eventual winner and I neck and neck throughout the game. 
  He had a city and a settlement on a gold-mine with a 12-spot that was rolled over
  8 times in the game.  Hard to beat that kind of resource production!         Later
  in the day we participated in Uberplay's small box games session.  I had been wanting
  to play Saga, and we found another father/son pair to join us.  Chris and Edison
  (who is also 9 - only 7 days older than Jacob) joined us for a great game that Jacob
  managed to win.  This is a pretty light card game but has some challenging strategy.
  Jacob beat us so soundly that I'm eager to play again to see what I was missing
  in my approach.  Greg Schloesser seems to have a similar opinion on this game.         Jacob
  and I volunteered to run demos at the Days of Wonder booth.  They produce such quality
  games that I couldn't resist a chance to represent them in some fashion. I taught
  Ticket to Ride and Memoir '44 to several groups.  Ticket to Ride, which Jacob is
  shown playing here, recently won the Spiel de Jahres and apparently is selling extremely
  well in Germany right now.         Our routine was for me to teach the game, then
  hand over to Jacob to play the game.  Jacob won this match of Memoir '44 (Omaha
  Beach scenario). Demos         The exhibition floor opened at 10am, and Jacob and
  I came in with the first wave.  We were immediately intrigued by the Spycraft demos
  being offered there.  AEG did a great job encouraging folks to try the game, and
  also rewarded us with T-shirts and starter packs for two factions.           Jacob's
  favorite demo of the day was Pirates of the Spanish Main, the new constructible
  strategy game from WizKids.  This game didn't appear very deep to me, but the theme
  and combat really entertained Jacob.         Now this was cool - check out the custom
  map made for the game here.  Might be worth waiting to play on this map tomorrow.
  Interesting New Releases         Bootleggers is the upcoming release about, well,
  bootlegging in the prohibition era.  Did you know that there's a liquor store chain
  in Indianapolis called The 21st Amendment?         A Clash of Kings is the newly
  released expansion to the fantastic A Game of Thrones boardgame.  Is this worth
  getting?         The new War of the Ring game set in Middle Earth is big in scale
  and price.         Here's a prototype for the upcoming release of Twilight Imperium,
  3rd Edition.         Another view of the prototype. Computer Games         MSN Online
  will be shipping their online version of Settlers of Catan around the end of this
  year.         We saw a demo for the new Sid Meier's Pirates, and it looks fantastic.         Here's
  the computer version of Axis & Allies, which appears to be a real-time strategy game
  set in WWII. GenCon Sights and Sounds         This was a cool area - lots of old,
  unwanted CCG cards strewn about for folks to build nifty structures like you see
  here.         Here's Jacob with the orange lady.         Visible evidence of the
  merger of Uberplay Games and Eagle Games.
