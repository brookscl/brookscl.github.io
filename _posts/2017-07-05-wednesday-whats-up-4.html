<ul>
<li><a href="http://wealthyaccountant.com/2016/09/21/library-millionaire/">Library Millionaire</a> – You probably have access to many more resources through your local libraries than you think. And if you live in a metro area, you might even be able to join multiple library systems.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-favorite-science-books-2017-6">11 books on science Bill Gates thinks everyone should read</a> – Case in point, I think my library has 3 or 4 of these available for me to download as eBooks.</li>

<h3 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h3>
<p>Many visitors at the lake over the past two weeks so plenty of gaming going on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks">No Thanks!</a> is my go-to bar game with more than 4 people. Easy to teach non-gamers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173346/7-wonders-duel">7 Wonders Duel</a> – still enjoying this 2 player game.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198953/pax-renaissance">Pax Renaissance</a> is the heaviest game I will play this summer and I continue to enjoy it. Takes the right kind of player to enjoy it, but the game goes more quickly than you might think given the complexity.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50381/cards-against-humanity">Cards Against Humanity</a> is one of a few party games played in the last 10 days.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33604/say-anything">Say Anything</a> – ditto</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit">Dixit</a> – ditto</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames">Codenames</a> – ditto</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205597/jump-drive">Jump Drive</a> is a streamlined Race for the Galaxy that I like playing. Also been playing the new iOS Race for the Galaxy (vs. AI only so far) and like it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180040/villages-valeria">Villages of Valeria</a> – Played this 4 or 5 times and I cannot figure it out. I get beat by even new players.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161417/red7">Red7</a> is a game where I may need to reconsider my rating of 7 as it has hidden depth. I’ve played 3 or 4 times in the past week.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170587/dont-mess-cthulhu">Don’t Mess with Cthulhu</a> – I’ve played a DIY version of the Time Bomb game and it is the hit of the week here. Werewolf has not been played, but this one has had 4 or 5 plays.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6688/ninety-nine">Ninety-Nine</a> – Excellent 3-player trick taking game you can play with a standard deck.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game">BANG! The Dice Game</a> – We had some kids here and they enjoy this game so we played it twice. Not my favorite but better and shorter than the original BANG!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209685/century-spice-road">Century: Spice Road</a> is a new game for me that my nephew brought out and it is quite fun. Similar to Splendor.</li>
