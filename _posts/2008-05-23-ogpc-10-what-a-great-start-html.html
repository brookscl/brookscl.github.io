excerpt: 'I had the pleasure of helping stage the first Oregon Game Project Challenge
  (ogpc 1.0), a state-wide project and team oriented computer game programming contest.
  The event was a big success (we think) - you can read the press release issued jointly
  by TechStart and the Oregon University System. Chris Sells had some great things
  to say about the event as a judge and keynote speaker. He did a great job and was
  very well received by this smart and savvy high school crowd.  Each team spent the
  day in a mix of activities:    Visiting with two separate judging panels    Presenting
  their project to a group of peer teams    Observing presentations from computer
  game industry professionals    Playing other teams'' games in our arcade    Playing
  a bit of Rock Band at the end of the day to wind down   I was the head judge and
  coordinated the recruiting of judges, the rubric for judging, and the final deliberation
  process (though I recused myself from leading it as Jacob was on a competing team).
  In the end an outstanding team called Phred from Philomath took the Champion Cup.  We''ll
  be back even stronger next year. We have grand plans to expand in multiple dimensions
  - stay tuned.'
