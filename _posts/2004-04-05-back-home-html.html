excerpt: Made it back home safely yesterday, flying from Beijing to Tokyo to Seattle
  to Portland.  Quite a bit easier coming back than flying out (shorter, less hassle).
  I'll be posting a gallery of photos from the trip shortly.  The trip overall was
  very successful from a business perspective, and by extending my stay by a day I
  was able to take in some of the sites around Beijing including the Great Wall and
  Ming Tombs.
