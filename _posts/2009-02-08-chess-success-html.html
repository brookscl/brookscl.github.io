excerpt: 'Last weekend I helped host a regional Chess for Success tournament at Sherwood
  Middle School. With a very strong 6th grade class joining our club of about 40 members
  I liked our chances of qualifying for the state tournament. The team is comprised
  of up to 10 players and the tournament is a swiss style individual team tournament.
  This means that each player is competing as an individual over 5 rounds of play,
  trying to accumulate as many points as possible (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw), and
  will generally not play someone from their own team. Swiss style means that a player
  is paired with another player with approximately the same score each round - the
  better you do, the more difficult the tournament becomes. Both Matthew (6th grade)
  and Jacob (8th grade) qualified for the team.  We had a great first round with 8
  out 10 players getting wins. This put us in a tie for first place as only the top
  4 individual scores are counted and it is fairly routine for many teams to accumulate
  the maximum four points in the initial round. The second round was brutal - of the
  8 players that won in the initial round, only 2 managed a win in the second. This
  put us at 6 points and we dropped to 5th place. The team regrouped and played strongly
  the next two rounds, accumulating 3 or 4 points in each round to put us in second
  place going into the final round. The top 2 teams qualify for state so we were carefully
  watching the point spread between us and third place (1.5 points). This was also
  the spread between us and the first place team. We had 6 players with 3 points after
  4 rounds (this means they had won 3 out of 4 games). I''ve coached teams in tournaments
  like this about 15 times and getting even 2 team points in a final round like this
  can be tough. The kids were well aware of the point situation and eagerly awaited
  each player as they exited the tournament room so that they could tabulate results.
  3 out of the 6 quickly got their wins, giving us 3 points and a guaranteed second
  place. Matthew was one of the final remaining players going for his 4th point and
  was well ahead, getting to a queen/pawn vs no pieces against his opponent - generally
  an easy win. Unfortunately he rushed things and fell into a stalemate trap. Still,
  that gave us 3.5 additional points and, by our calculations, a tournament victory.  It
  was a great team effort with three of our players finishing in second place in the
  individual category, and everyone pulling strongly for the team. We compete in the
  state championship in March in a true "team" tournament - 4 players competing against
  4 from the opposing team. '
