<p>We made it to our final hiking and camping destination - Grand Canyon. We spent day one setting up camp and being tourists around the south rim trail.</p>

<p>I've been here once before, in 1984, but only remember seeing the view from the rim. It was nice to see more of the architecture and different viewpoints around the village.</p>

<p>And see a nice sunset. Air quality is very good right now.</p>

<p>Today we hiked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandview_Trail?wprov=sfti1">Grandview Trail</a> to Horseshoe Mesa, a drop of about 2,500 feet in 2.5 miles. Similar to the Bear Mountain hike we did in Sedona, but backwards.</p>

<p>I'm playing amateur geologist on our hikes, pointing out the different strata and the very-old-ness of the terrain we are on (250 million to about 320 million on this hike - older than dinosaurs!). Down at the mesa were the remnants of an old copper and uranium mine. On the rocks you can see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azurite?wprov=sfti1">azurite</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachite?wprov=sfti1">malachite</a>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we descend into the canyon for five days. See you on the other side!</p>
