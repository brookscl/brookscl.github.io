excerpt: 'Well, I''m only about 2 weeks late in posting this one.  We hosted a mystery
  party for Jacob and a few friends two Saturdays ago - sort of like a "How to Host
  a Murder" game but for kids.  The theme was western, and we asked the party goers
  to dress the part.  Jacob only invited boys, and there were a few girl parts, so
  we had to improvise.  Part of the improvisation was having Matthew dress up as a
  girl - and Grandma was more than happy to help out.  Check out the results for yourself;
  should make for some great blackmail material somewhere down the road.    The party
  went very well - we mixed in some games with the mystery puzzle, and everyone played
  their parts. Jacob is nine now, and thought it seems cliche to say that I can''t
  believe how fast he is growing up, well, I can''t believe how fast he is growing
  up!    Yesterday, Jacob played in his last football game of the season, and his
  team finished 8-0.  Not a bad season!  Jacob played out the year as the starting
  center, and was getting much more playing time on defense as well.  Julie and I
  are sold on the value of this program for Jacob, and we are eager to sign up Matthew
  as soon as he is old enough. '
