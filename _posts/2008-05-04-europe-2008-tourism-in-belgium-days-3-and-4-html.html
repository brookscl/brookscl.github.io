excerpt: 'The weather in Belgium was very thematic for Bulge historical site visits,
  but not so nice for some of the activities we were hoping to do. Matthew helped
  plan the Belgium portion of the trip, and his #1 priority was visiting the Plopsa
  Coo amusement park near Stavelot. We averaged about 2 inches of snow per day and
  experienced some severe whiteout conditions while driving from Bastogne to La Roche
  on our 2nd night. That wouldn''t stop us from making the most of the amusement park,
  however.  Plopsa Coo is a clean, smallish amusement park not unlike the regional
  parks you''ll see in the USA and as good as anything we have in the Pacific Northwest
  which is surprisingly devoid of thrill ride parks. It is geared toward smaller children
  but has a few rides to keep bigger kids interested.  Not that the kid rids kept
  Matthew away. We had to wait quite a while for the roller coaster and log flume
  to open up as they cleared snow and prepared the rides for safe use. Matthew stayed
  busy with the evil bunny ride, the slow cars that you can''t actually steer, and
  good old fashioned playground rides with Jacob and Julie. The rest of us tried to
  stay warm.  We took a few rides on the roller coaster which was most enjoyable because
  of the snow and beautiful scenery - the ride itself was rather short and not terribly
  thrilling. The key is that Matthew had a blast and I earned some credits allowing
  me to spend more time visiting WWII sites. After finishing at Plopsa around 1pm
  we made our way into Stavelot to visit the Abbey. The interesting parts of the abbey
  are surprising - there''s a nice English language audio tour of the museum which
  goes into great detail on the local area history as well as the construction of
  the abbey. Things get really interesting in the basement where there is an automobile
  and motorcycle racing museum complete with Sony PS2 and PS3 kiosks that kept us
  entertained.  The ruins in front of the abbey made for a nice battlefield for a
  snowball fight for the boys. After visiting a few more Bulge sites we made our way
  back to La Roche for a bit of rest followed by our last evening meal in town.  We
  strolled around town looking for some interesting dinner options and ultimately
  made our way across the Ourthe to eat at La Brasserie Ardennaise. They had a fine
  selection of beer, wine, and local flavor dishes - highly recommended. Of course
  David and I had to order our standby favorite Trappistes Rochefort 10.  The picture
  below is from the bridge just in front of the restaurant with the feudal castle
  in the background.  This would be our last night in Belgium - next day we head to
  Reims, France but not without a few more stops in western Belgium.  Our first stop
  was the Castle of Bouillon near the French border. Fortunately we left our puppy
  behind, because apparently it is commonplace for the local raptors to fly away with
  the cuter ones.  Raptors at the castle? Yes indeed! One of the surprises at this
  outstanding castle was the birds of prey show put on by a local falconer. Even though
  the production was in French, the demonstrations of owls, hawks, eagles, condors,
  and falcons was first rate and kept us very entertained.  Our final stop in Belgium
  was the Orval Abbey, famous for its beer, cheese, and yellow stone ruins and new
  construction. The weather was spectacular and the boys had a great time playing
  some hide and seek in the ruins. I also had Matthew take a picture of our group
  to ensure that people would believe that I actually went on this trip.  We thoroughly
  enjoyed wandering the ruins for a while and finished our visit at the gift shop
  where I picked up a 4-pack of beer with an Orval glass.  That''s it for Belgium,
  the highlight of our trip for me especially when you consider the Bulge / WWII sites
  we were able to visit. That will be the subject of my next few posts, followed by
  a wrap-up of our visit to Reims and Paris.'
