excerpt: " Two consecutive Fridays, two consecutive train gaming sessions.  How different
  they can be!   Last Friday I hosted an evening of 18XX gaming, a rare pleasure these
  days and as satisfying as always.  We had enough people to split into two separate
  games - 18AL and 18Scan.  Couldn't talk Jacob into playing this time - he covets
  his free weekend evenings which is the only time he gets to play video or console
  games.    Eric has become our 18XX guru in terms of collecting and teaching the
  games.  He led the 18AL game while Matt, George and I struggled through the rules
  for 18Scan.  His version of 18AL is like mine - mostly hand-made but with nice components.
  \ Still, it underscores how amazing the productions from John Tamplin at Deep Thought
  Games are - I hope he continues to do his craftwork.    My impression of 18Scan
  is that is short, sweet, but has a few more tricky rules than the other short games
  I've played.  I stayed out of some of the initial private company auctions and let
  Matt and George fight over them, hoping to preserve some cash to get a head start
  on the public companies.   This strategy served me well - for a while.  I think
  I was probably in the lead for most of the game, but as I hit my certificate limit
  near the endgame I got a bit restless and did a stock transaction that I was to
  regret.  I sold a share of one of Matt's companies but failed to realize that it
  wouldn't reduce the share value. His company continued to soar while I gained little
  to nothing in the transaction.  It was an extremely close finish, with Matt edging
  me out by about 100 Kr and George a bit further behind me.  This game took about
  4.5 hours to finish, but would likely take 3-3.5 hours if we ever manage to play
  it again.  Julie's uncle was in town last weekend and we brought out Ticket to Ride:
  Europe as a gateway / introductory game to teach Bill.  He caught on quickly and
  I think he enjoyed it quite a bit.  I pulled out a slim margin win, with Jacob coming
  in a close second.  I was able to focus on eastern Europe without too much distraction,
  allowing me to finish 5 tickets including a long run. "
