excerpt: Yesterday (2 days ago?) I made the long journey from Portland to Kuala Lumpur,
  Malaysia. I departed PDX about 9:45am on Friday morning, flying to SFO.  Thanks
  to United's much improved wireless access (thanks TMobile) I was able to catch up
  on quite a bit of work in the Red Carpet lounges in both PDX and SFO.  At about
  1pm I boarded the 747-400 in SFO to fly to Shanghai, China.  It has been over three
  years since I did a flight of this length - over 14 hours.         The impressive
  Shanghai airport. We arrived in Shanghai about 6pm local time (did you know that
  all of China has the same time zone?) - this is where some confusion set in.  The
  kind flight attendants on the United flight assured me that I wouldn't have to clear
  customs in China if I was simply transferring to another international flight (turns
  out I was the only one on this flight doing so!).  So I didn't bother to fill out
  the immigration and customs paperwork.  The agent that processed my check-in at
  PDX had been a bit ambiguous about what would happen to my luggage in Shanghai;
  I think it is unusual for people to connect to China Eastern. Upon departing the
  plane, I was pretty worried about my luggage and I had a couple of hours, so I proceeded
  to baggage claim to see if it showed up there.  Of course it did, so I grabbed it
  and tried to follow the signs to international transfers.  The agent there insisted
  that I need to go through customs and check in upstairs at the desk.  I am heading
  to Beijing after my stay in KL, so I have a Chinese visa in my passport - this made
  clearing immigration and customs very straightforward.  But what if I didn't have
  a visa (which would have been the case if I had only been traveling to KL)?  I was
  able to check in for my flight, but before heading to the gate I had to come up
  with an airport tax of 90 Yuan RMB.  This seemed much more complicated than it needed
  to be, and I'm still wondering if there was a way to deal with this without passing
  through immigration. Still, I made it to KL without a hitch, arriving at 2:15am
  local time, and finally arriving at my hotel around 4:00am.  I had managed to sleep
  for about 6 hours total on my two flights (over a 24 hour period), so I didn't need
  a ton of sleep.  This was good, as my rest was, well, restless but at least I managed
  3 hours of sleep.        View of the KL skyline from my hotel room. We are in the
  tropics here, so things are quite warm, and I woke up to a fairly hazy Sunday morning. 
  Today is a day of rest and, hopefully, some recreation with my colleague Trevor
  who is stationed here.
