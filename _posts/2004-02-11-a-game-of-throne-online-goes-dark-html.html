excerpt: 'Bowing to pressure from Fantasy Flight Games, the great folks that built
  A Game of Thrones Online have taken the game down.  Apparently one of the concerns
  is physical game ownership of the players that are playing online:  They did have
  one interesting requirement, however, which has compelled me to launch a question
  on the forum (http://www.agotonline.com/forum/):All judges and PBeM games ''must
  be structured in such a way that it is impossible to play without owning a copy
  of the game.''I am not sure how we can comply with this request.  In reality, there
  is no way to determine whether a human judge needs a copy of the game since the
  rules are published on their Web site.  Though we heavily encourage ownership of
  the game and very much want everyone to own a copy, I can''t know for sure that
  every player owns a copy.  (Or do we just need one of the five players to own a
  copy?) I think this is a bad move by the Fantasy Flight.  They run the risk of alienating
  the very individuals most likely to evangelize their games.'
