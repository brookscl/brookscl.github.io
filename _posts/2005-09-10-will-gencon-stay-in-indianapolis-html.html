excerpt: 'Apparently the Indianapolis Star reported yesterday (can’t find the story
  online) that GenCon is leaving Indianapolis.  Peter Adkison, CEO of Gen Con LLC,
  posted this to the GPA mailing list:  Yesterday in the Indy Star it was reported
  that Gen Con is leaving Indianapolis.Consider this rumor control: no such decision
  has been made. What is true is that our contract is up after 2006 and we are examing
  our options. I''ll be conducting a four-city tour next week of possible venues throughout
  the midwest.My preference would be to stay in Indianapolis as I know first hand
  how risky it is to move a convention of this magnitude. But I do think it only prudent
  to compare alternatives and make sure I''m getting a good deal.  If GenCon moves,
  I doubt I’ll find my way there.  There are other conventions I would rather go to,
  and the only reason this one makes the cut is that we both have a lot of family
  there.'
