excerpt: 'As Scott mentioned  yesterday, we''ve been playing with InfoPath and we
  were sufficiently  impressed.  We had some great meetings with Microsoft today,
  and took some  time to demo the tools for some Microsofties that hadn''t had the
  time yet to see  the environment.  We did the same demo - building a simple front-end
  for  adding new weblog entries to ChrisAn''s  BlogX.  Demo worked great - went from
  nothing to spell-checking  front-end in less than 3 minutes. Someone then mentioned
  how cool it would be if the .xsn specification file  was completely transparent
  as well (read: XML), but we were disappointed to  learn (after opening in Notepad)
  that it is clearly a binary format.  How  could they stoop so low? So what do I
  learn after arriving in my hotel room and pulling down my feeds  in NewsGator? 
  Clemens  points out that it is just a CAB  file.  And inside you can find tidy little
  (OK, so not all of them are  quite so little) XML, XSLT, XSD, JS file.  Pleasant  surprise.'
