<p>Allen and I both had the same idea coming away from <a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2019/05/08/gmt-weekend-in-the-west-spring-2019/">GMT West</a> - seeing <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62227/labyrinth-war-terror-2001">Labyrinth</a> played made us both long to get it back on the table. This game opened the door for the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/18749/gmt-coin-series">COIN series</a> of games, providing a truly asymmetric two player gaming experience focused on the American war on terror beginning 2001. I had played two or three times before (with Jacob and Matthew I think) but never focused enough on the game to 1/ get a solid grasp on rules and 2/ understand even basic strategies for the two sides.</p>

<p>Allen and I played face to face last week, I took Jihadists and he the Americans. I pulled off the win, with both of us learning that an early regime change for the USA can result in a serious quagmire.</p>
<p>Then we each played a solo game, using the enhanced boys that came with the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173251/labyrinth-awakening-2010">Awakening</a> expansion. Seeing the boys play is a great human training approach, with limitations of course.</p>
<p>We played again face to face the day before I left Oregon, switching sides. I was the benefactor of some good die rolls and an American focus on good relations in the central middle east paid off for the win.</p>
