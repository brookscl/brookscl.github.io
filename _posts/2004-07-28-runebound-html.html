excerpt: About a week ago, Jacob and I joined Ken and Brandon at the Rude household
  for a game of Runebound, the fantasy boardgame from Fantasy Flight Games.  This
  game is right up our alley - great theme, easy to learn, some dice rolling, and
  plenty of action.          Brandon, Jacob, and Ken early on in the game. Each player
  takes the role of one of twelve heros, either randomly or by mutually agreed choice,
  and the objective is to complete a quest.  In the case of the scenario included
  with the game, this means defeating the evil lord Margath or collecting three dragon
  runes (usually by defeating three dragons). Gameplay is very straightforward.  On
  a player's turn, he rolls movement dice (5 if in a town, 4 otherwise) to determine
  the allowable terrain through which his hero may pass this turn.  This creates some
  limitations and often dictates what a player will try and do.  Most of the game
  is spent going to towns to heal or hire allies or purchase goods, or attempting
  to defeat encounters (usually monsters).  Encounters are color-coded depending on
  difficulty, and defeating an encounter gives the hero experience and some additional
  reward (gold, an item, or perhaps an ability to use later).          Closeup of
  the hero counters.  You can also see some of the encounter chits (green, yellow
  in this case). We played the basic rules and found the game very enjoyable, if a
  bit too long with too much downtime.  Four is definitely the most I would play with,
  2 or 3 would be even better.  We found ourselves multi-tasking a bit, having the
  next player roll and start his move while the previous player finished his turn.
  Combat was very confusing to learn at first - it isn't always clear what choices
  you have and what is mandatory, especially when you are joined by allies in battle. 
  We worked our way through it though, and I'm fairly sure we got things mostly right
  based on some reasearch I did after playing.  Make sure you read the FAQ! There's
  plenty of luck in this game, and it can be very frustrating!  Jacob had a very difficult
  time at first and fell behind quickly mostly due to poor rolls in his first few
  battles.  Goes with the territory in a game like this.  We stopped before the game
  finished after about 3 hours of play, and gave the Ken the victory as he was the
  only one who had collected a dragon rune. There is a planned expansion coming out
  soon which should keep things interesting.  Jacob, Matthew, and I plan on playing
  this weekend, and we will certainly try out the advanced rules this time to raise
  the challenge bar and complexity a bit.
