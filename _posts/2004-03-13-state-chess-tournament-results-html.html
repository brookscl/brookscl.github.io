excerpt: We did pretty well at the state chess tournament - the team finished with
  2.0 points out of a possible 5.0, putting us solidly in the middle of the pack. 
  Jacob played in three of the five matches and finished with 2 points, so we are
  very proud of him.  His two wins came at critical points - he was the last player
  on his team still playing in the match and needed a win to ensure either a win or
  tie for his team.        The tournament was held at the Portland World Trade Center,
  and we spent most of our time between matches in the covered atrium.        The
  chess team - Jacob, Jackson, Justin, Conner, Spencer, and Coach (me).
