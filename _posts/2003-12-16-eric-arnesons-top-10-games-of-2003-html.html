excerpt: Eric Arneson just published his Top 10 Games of 2003 list.  I agree with
  many of his choices, though I haven't played all of the games he mentioned.  I especially
  appreciate his nods to I'm the Boss, New England, Mystery of the Abbey, Balloon
  Cup, and Battle Ball.  I don't think Battle Ball would have made my top 10 list,
  but it is a fun game, especially for one that has a mass market presence.  I'll
  have to publish my top 10 list shortly...
