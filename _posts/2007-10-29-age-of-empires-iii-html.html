excerpt: 'With a rare free Sunday, the boys and I took the dive into boardgaming again
  and played Age of Empires III.  KC and I did a joint order at Funagain recently
  and I finally met up with him for lunch on Friday to pick up my games.  This was
  one of them, along with Caylus Magna Carta and To Court the King.    This game ranks
  pretty low on the complexity scale (compared to other big box games) and pretty
  high on the fun scale, though it did feel quite a bit like Caylus, Pillars of the
  Earth, and other games in this genre.  The boys are inexperienced enough that they
  just enjoyed the game.  We played this learning game in just over 2 hours, and I
  won by a healthy margin.  The boys will learn to pay more attention to the scoring
  rounds and getting colonists on the board next time!     Now it will be interesting
  to try Caylus Magna Carta to see if one scratches the itch better than the other.  I
  love Caylus but it plays too long for most sessions.  AoE seems to fit in the 2
  hour category just fine, and Magna Carta should as well. '
