excerpt: This is mostly just an entry for me to remember where to find the stuff,
  but here is the best place to find the list of Tivo hacks for modifying default
  settings.  Every once in a while we reset the Tivo and I need to reset some things
  to my desired state.  Most usefule is the 30 second advance feature (Select-Play-Select-3-0-Select).
