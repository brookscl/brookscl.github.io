excerpt: " We are going to head up to Mt Hood Meadows tomorrow early for our first
  ski of the season.  We missed all of last year, probably for the first time since
  Julie and I got married.  The only problem is that it is exceptionally cold here
  (for Oregon), and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see temperatures in the teens tomorrow
  morning when we start. Given that it’s been about 2 years since we last went, Jacob
  has of course outgrown his equipment and Matthew has moved into Jacob’s.  That meant
  a drive over to GI Joes tonight to rent equipment for Jacob.  At $14 a pop, we’ll
  probably stick to that for this year as I doubt we’ll go more than 3–4 times given
  our other commitments."
