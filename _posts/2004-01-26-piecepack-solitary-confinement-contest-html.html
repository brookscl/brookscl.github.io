excerpt: " I can't believe I forgot to post this.  A while back I mentioned the latest
  PiecePack design contest, Solitary Confinement.  I even submitted a (very lightweight)
  entry, PieceGaps.  Earlier this month the contest results were posted, and Piece
  Packing Pirates is the winner.  I haven't played it yet, but I do hope to soon."
