excerpt: I learned about Attacktix from Mark Johnson and picked up a starter set and
  booster at Target last week.  I thought the kids might get a kick out of them. 
  They’ve played every day for the past three days, including a three-way battle with
  the Rude kids.  It takes about 30 seconds to learn the rules, and don’t expect any
  deep strategy.  It brings concrete rules to something all us geeks did as kids still
  do – have pretend fights with our Star Wars action figures.  The most innovative
  mechanic is movement, which is done by counting clicks on a roller-wheel under the
  base.
