excerpt: I failed to mention in my final Origins post that I participated in an ad-hoc
  tournament on Friday.  This wasn’t a typical tournament for me – I got roped into
  a foam sword combat tournament with 7 other players sponsored by Edhellen Armoury. 
  We played through an elimination bracket and I somehow managed to win. Jacob and
  Matthew have coveted those foam swords ever since they first saw that at GenCon
  a few years ago.  Given that they won’t make it to GenCon, Essen, or Origins this
  year, I wanted to bring back a special gift for them.  So of course after winning
  the tournament and getting a taste of play combat, I had to pick up a sword and
  shield for each of the boys. These games are played by a strict set of rules – the
  Belegarth Book of War.  The emphasis is on safety and honor, offering some nice
  boundaries and lessons for the boys.  For example, you are required to call hits
  on yourself and aren’t supposed to call hits on your opponent (i.e., no “hey, I
  hit your arm!”).  I like honor systems like this and the spirit of competition it
  fosters.  The boys have had some fun dueling in our back yard, and even Julie has
  joined the action.  I was most surprised by how aerobic the activity was – after
  the tournament at Origins I was completely spent.
