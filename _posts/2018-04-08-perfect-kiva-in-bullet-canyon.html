<p>Our final ruin while backpacking was “Perfect Kiva”, so named because of its pristine condition. Note also the grooves in the rocks from grinding corn. This is sandstone so the resulting cornmeal would be laden with grit. Combine that with the high sugar content of corn and you can see why the people had major dental problems (grinding and rot).</p>
