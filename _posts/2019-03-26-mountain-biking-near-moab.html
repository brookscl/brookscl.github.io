<p>Today was our first mountain biking adventure in Moab and, frankly, the first mountain biking we've done in 20+ years. We chose an intermediate adventure with <a href="https://rimtours.com/">Rim Tours</a> and it was perfect for us. Our route took us along the west side of Arches and included some decent climbing and plenty of slick rock traversing. And I only fell twice, and neither time was into a canyon!</p>
