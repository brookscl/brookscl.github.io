excerpt: We had a special event this afternoon – a surgery session by our two resident
  doctors, Dave and Lisa.  They removed a sebaceous cyst from Karen’s head.  I’m serious…
  they performed surgery right on our kitchen table here.  And Karen is sitting next
  to me as I write this so I guess she turned out ok.  I’m going to spare you all
  from seeing all of the photos UNLESS you want to follow the link below.  I caution
  you – this is not for the faint of heart so you’ve been warned. You can check out
  all of the surgery photos here.
