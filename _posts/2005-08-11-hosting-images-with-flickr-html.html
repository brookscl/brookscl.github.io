excerpt: I continue to bump into bandwidth limits with my ISP, Stormhosts.  While
  they remain very affordable, given the image-rich blog that I provide I'm wondering
  if I should just start hosting all of my images over at Flickr.  I'm certain I'll
  save money and the management and tagging tools are pretty sweet.  Any reason why
  I shouldn't do this?
