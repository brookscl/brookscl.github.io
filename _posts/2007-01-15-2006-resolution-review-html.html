excerpt: 'While I focused primarily on my unplayed games burndown throughout 2006,
  I actually set 5 distinct goals back in January 2006.  Let''s review how I did on
  each goal. 1. Attend at least one mid-week gaming session a month (besides my own).
  This is mostly a matter of putting it on my schedule and making it a priority. I’m
  lucky to attend every other month, mostly due to my travel schedule. I estimate
  that I made about 9-10 mid-month gaming sessions.  I started tracking my games played
  during the second half of the year, but have to guestimate for the first half. 
  I''m making more of Mike''s sessions (closer to home) but still have a hard time
  making it to Doug''s and have never made a trip to Matt''s.   2. Play through my
  current owned but un-played list. I’ll probably post this next week with some comments.
  I’m allowed to add new games that go right into my un-played list. Maybe I’ll get
  to those next year. I think I might put a big burn-down chart on my game-room wall
  to track my progress. This one got the most attention last year, and you can read
  my final 2006 burndown report.  I got through all but 2 of my unplayed games.  
  3. Play significantly more casual, short games at home with the family. I’ve already
  had some good success with this in the past week, playing Lost Cities twice with
  Jacob and Blink with Matthew. We also squeezed in a three-player game of Wyatt Earp
  this evening. This is hard to measure (not a very SMART goal) but the intent will
  pay off. True, this was hard to measure.  I don''t think I did very well in this
  area, especially playing lighter games with Matthew.  What I have done is play a
  lot more heavy 2-player games with Jacob, which has been a real treat for both of
  us.  Games we played in the last year include Twilight Struggle, Command & Colors:
  Ancients, ASL Starter Kit #1, and Through the Ages.  Hardly casual, short fare.
  4. Organize and run sessions at GameStorm. I did this two years ago but didn’t last
  year. Not sure what I’ll run – any suggestions? We will definitely run some prototype
  playtestings for Sunriver Games, but I’d like to run something unusual/unlikely.
  Perhaps Battlestations would be a good choice. I did some prototype playtesting
  and helped run the 2-player game tournament.  I also managed to run a number of
  unscheduled casual games like Can''t Stop, Byzantium, and Munchkin.  This year I
  may help run a Kniziathon. 5. Improve my critical writing skills, particularly when
  reviewing and evaluating games. This takes time (that I’m not sure I have), practice,
  and personal content review/editing. I’d like be able to decompose a game as well
  as Chris Farrell but be a little less of a curmudgeon.  Talk about unmeasurable! 
  I''ll let you, the reader, judge this.  I do know that I have not fundamentally
  changed my writing process in that I don''t spend any more time editing or reviewing
  when I post then I did in 2005.   I''ve done some 2007 goal setting, but none of
  those are really focused on gaming.  One of those is to finish 2007 with no unplayed
  games in my collection - should be easier this year given that I''m starting with
  only two!  Julie and I have also set some financial goals that will limit my game
  purchasing, which is just fine by me.  I suspect I''ll be buying more wargames this
  year than euros, partly because I''ve already P500''d a number of games that will
  eventually show up on my doorstep.  I will post shortly on games that I''m most
  interested in seeing in 2007.'
