excerpt: 'Somehow I got on the email list for Army ROTC alumni at Washington University. 
  Probably an alumni database screwup, as I was actually in Air Force ROTC there. 
  This week I received a newsletter talking about what''s going on with the Army ROTC
  detachment this year, and included was some funny Army Humor that I thought I would
  share.    VOICE MAILThank you for calling the United States Army.  I’m sorry, but
  all of our units are out at the moment, or are otherwise engaged.  Please leave
  a message with your country, name or organization, the region, the specific crisis,
  and a number at which we can call you.  As soon as we have sorted out the Balkans,
  Iraq, Korea, China, the Y2K Bug, marching up and down the streets of Washington
  DC, and compulsory “Consideration Of Others” training, we will return your call.
  Please speak after the tone, or if you require more options, please listen carefully
  to the following numbers:  If your crisis is small, and close to the sea, press
  1 for the United States Marine Corps. If your concern is distant, with a temperate
  climate and good hotels, and can be solved by one or two low risk, high altitude
  bombing runs, please press 2 for the United States Air Force.  Please note this
  service is not available after 1630 hours, or on weekends.  Special consideration
  will be given to customers requiring satellite or stealth technology who can provide
  additional research and development funding. If your inquiry concerns a situation
  which can be resolved by a bit of gray funnel, bunting, flags and a really good
  marching band, please write, well in advance, to the United States Navy.  Please
  note that Tomahawk missile service is extremely limited and will be provided on
  a first-come, first-served basis. If inquiry is not urgent, please press 3 for the
  Rapid Deployment Force. If you are in real hot trouble, please press 4, and your
  call will be routed to the United States Army Special Operations Command.  Please
  note that a compulsory credit check will be required to ensure you can afford the
  inherent TDY costs.  Also be aware that USASOC may bill your account at any time
  and is not required to tell you why, as it may be classified. If you are interested
  in joining the Army and wish to be shouted at, paid little, have premature arthritis,
  put your wife and family in a condemned hut miles from civilization, are prepared
  to work your butt off daily, risking your life, in all weather and terrain, both
  day and night, and whilst watching Congress erode your original benefits package,
  then please stay on the line.  Your call will shortly be connected to a bitter,
  passed-over Army recruiter in an old strip mall down by the Post Office. Have a
  pleasant day, and thank you again for trying to contact the United States Army.'
