excerpt: ' If you follow this weblog (and the now defunct Gathering of Engineers blog)
  you know that I had a New Years resolution to play through my current owned but
  unplayed collection of games.  This lead to a tracking and execution model of burning
  down the list.  2006 is now behind me and I''ll give myself a qualified success
  score on the project.  I finished the year with 2 unplayed games in my collection
  (minus games I''ve moved to my trade/sell list). Some interesting statistics:  I
  started the year with 83 unplayed games in my collection I peaked at 118 unplayed
  plus newly played in 2006 games in early November (post Essen).  This means I added
  about 35 games to my collection this year, not including games I purchased that
  I had already played. I sold, traded, or gave away 30 games that were on my unplayed
  list at some time during the year. In case you want to track my updates through
  the year, here''s a summary:  February March May August August October November
  Here''s my final burndown chart.  Thanks to the help of a dedicated set of friends
  and family, I was able to close out the year by knocking 14 games off the list in
  less than 48 hours.  These weren''t just little card games either - we played some
  meaty games like Imperial, Shogun, and El Caballero.  Here''s a brief wrap-up of
  each game played with some commentary: Der Dieb von Bagdad The running commentary
  in my game group (at least with KC and Rita) is how good this game is and how bad
  the dice game is.  Color me random, but I think I like the dice game a bit more. 
  At least this game doesn''t have a simultaneous selection mechanism to choose what
  room to go to - that would drop it down to a 2 or 3 rating for me. Employee of the
  Month It was hard to get past some of the graphical design / human factors issues
  with this game, but it was a decent diversion. Fraud Squad Basically Clue without
  a board, this one dragged on too long for us to finish.  There are simply too many
  permutations to track and everyone found it to be too much work and too little fun. 
  Plus, I don''t get the inclusion of a roll-the-die-and-you-might-lose-a-turn mechanic.
  El Caballero I was tired, distracted, and not really paying attention to this game
  but I still managed to win.  That can''t be a good thing, but I''ll be willing to
  try this one again. Shogun One of the highlights of the weekend for me.  I love
  it and am now wondering if I should trade away my pasted-up Wallenstein copy. Bosworth
  Chess One of the surprises of the weekend for me, despite KC''s frustration is the
  middle / 3rd player in what really should be a 2 OR 4 player game, not a 2-4 player
  game.  I think there''s a fun little chess variant here and I look forward to trying
  it with my chess club. Socks in the City Not much to say here - this was in the
  category of "OK, let''s get this out and be done with it".  Thanks KC for teaching
  and bearing with me on the play.  This will go to the trade/giveaway pile. Master
  Labyrinth I found this in shrink at a Goodwill and it will be a nice donation to
  the school.  I don''t see any reason to keep this if you already own Amazing Labyrinth,
  which I do like. Hero Clix I somehow talked Julie into playing this with me, and
  we both came away with the same impression.  Boring, tedious to lookup the abilities
  in external charts, and mostly just a stand around and attack game. Starship Catan
  Ken and I played this on Sunday morning and we both loved the experience.  It played
  in under 2 hours and we think we could get it down to an hour now that we understand
  the game.  I expect to see this come out quite a bit once Jacob and I give it another
  try.  Julie might enjoy it too. Big Kini I did not expect to like this game but
  came away very satisfied.  It looks and feels similar to Tongiaki but it is heavier
  with less randomness/chaos and some interesting mechanics.  It did tend to regress
  into min-maxing at the end which dragged out the final stage of the game. Imperial  I
  was able to sit out for an hour of this 2:15 length game because I lost control
  of the UK to my own son Jacob.  I still managed to beat Ken and KC (hah!) but Brandon
  and Jacob ruled the day and finished 1-2.  I''ll likely be writing more about this
  well designed war/economic game hybrid. New York Central It took a while for me
  to get this game going - the rules are a bit convoluted and I need to write some
  play tips on the geek to help others.  Still, this is a decent stock / train game
  played with cards that I''m going to keep and bring out some more this year.  We
  played in about 35 minutes.  The main question we have is how controllable the game
  is with bad card draws. Crazy Diamond - Karatino We played the shorter Karatino
  game... what a dog.  I suppose I''ll try the Crazy Diamond game before letting this
  one loose, but I don''t have high hopes. Unplayed Games  Wooden Shoes and Iron Monsters
  This was just too long and too complicated to consider bringing out over the weekend. 
  I really don''t know what to expect with this game but given my groups fondness
  for 18xx games of late, maybe it won''t be too hard to get it out. Das Sceptor von
  Zavandor We skipped this primarily because I don''t have the English pasteups yet
  for the cards - just a reference guide. Games Moved to the Trade Pile History of
  the World Britannia These are both "old" versions of the games, and I just don''t
  think they''ll get out enough in my group or family. Hellas (German version) I didn''t
  know how language dependent this game was when I picked it up on sale during a trip
  through Germany last year. Cannes - Stars, Scripts and Screens This was an add-on
  to my Indonesia purchase at Essen 2005, and I should have skipped it. Final Thoughts
  This process had the desired effect - refocusing my attention on my collection for
  playability and not just for collecting.  I''m committed to keeping the number of
  games in my collection approximately flat and I''d like to finish each year with
  as close to zero unplayed games as possible.  The end result is going to mean fewer
  purchased games in 2007 and focusing on playing the ones I have.'
