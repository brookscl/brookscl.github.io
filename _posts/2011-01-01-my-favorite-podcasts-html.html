<p>I spend about 90 minutes commuting in the car each day and primarily listen to podcasts when alone in the car. I think I'm about 7 years into regular podcast listening (I remember burning some onto CDs when my mp3 player could only hold 32MB) and I've certainly settled on a few favorites that are in regular rotation. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>EconTalk: Don't Be fooled - this isn't a theoretical or academic podcast on economics. JD turned me onto this about 2 years ago and it has been in steady rotation. My favorite 2010 episode was an interview of a hair stylist turned entrepreneur who is exploring innovative compensation models in a hair salon. </li>
<li>Mac Power Users: A worthy newcomer though I find myself skipping an episode now and then. Favorites in 2010 were on MultiMarkDown and iTunes. </li>
<li>MacBreak Weekly: To understand just how important Leo Laporte is to this show, listen to it while he's on vacation. A great cast of characters with frequent obscure references plus worthy iOS and Mac recommendations (and prognostications) make this a weekly listen for me. </li>
<li>The Dice Tower: This is the one and only boardgaming podcast that I listen to and it gets better every year. Eric Summerer as the co-host has taken the quality up a notch.  And I <em>love</em> the Game Tech segments. </li>
<li>PhotoFocus: Scott Bourne has the cred to be cocky and he is, but I learn something new every time I listen to this digital photography Q&amp;A show. A steady stream of guest hosts keeps it fresh. </li>
<li>Travel with Rick Steves: Each time I listen it reinforces how traveling overseas only every other year is not enough. My favorite episodes were about the Whiskey Trail and Turkey / Greece relations. </li>
<li>The Pipeline: Excellent interview show hosted by <a href="http://danbenjamin.com/">Dan Benjamin</a>. </li>
<li>This American Life: Yes, this is the public radio show. Relaxing diversion. </li>
<li>The Dave Ramsey Show: This gets fewer listens these days. It used to be a favorite of the boys, but one traumatic fact of our debt-ridden society is that you keep hearing the same stories over and over again. </li>
<li>Manager Tools: I tend to listen in batches when I need some inspiration and focus in my day job. Great management basics covered here, and they have a dedicated RSS feed to catch you up on the 101 stuff. </li>
</ul>
