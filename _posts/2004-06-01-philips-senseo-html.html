excerpt: Sorry for the brief diversion into home appliance review, but I'm pleased
  enough with my recent purchase of the Philips Senseo that I just had to share my
  thoughts. About a month ago I noticed that Target was having a sale on these devices. 
  I had been looking for a solo, cartridge or packet based coffee maker for a while
  but wasn't willing to spend the $100+ the European models were going for.  I'm the
  only one in the house that drinks coffee, and I prefer to grind my own beans.  Sometimes
  I like to make espresso as well, so our counter was consumed with a grinder, a plain-old-brew
  style coffee maker, and an espresso machine.  Clean-up is very much a pain, especially
  when you grind your own beans and have a tile counter.         The Senseo uses mesh
  pods, minimizing clean-up mess. I would suspect that the cost-per-cup is higher
  than alternatives, but when you factor in that there is no waste (I drink every
  bit that I brew) it seems very reasonable.  A package of 18 pods costs about $3.35,
  and new suppliers (like General Mills) are getting into the business of making pods
  which should create some more price pressure.         You can make either a single
  cup or two cups at a time.  My preference is two-cups into the same mug. The resulting
  coffee is about half-way between a standard brew and espresso, which is just about
  perfect for my taste.  If the coffee is too strong or bitter, you can run a second
  cup through the same pod to weaken the flavor a bit.  I wouldn't say it makes the
  best cup of coffee I've had - I still prefer the output from a good espresso machine. 
  Still, it is much better than a standard brew and much easier to deal with.
