excerpt: " I don't play collectible card games (CCGs) much any more.  If I do, it
  is usually with pre-constructed starter decks or with out-of-print games (like 7th
  Sea) that I can come by cheaply.  I'm not so much of a “board game elitist” that
  I won't admit that I love these games though - I just don't have the patience or
  time for deck construction.  After my first play of the Game of Thrones CCG yesterday
  I'm seriously tempted to buy some more cards and dig into it a bit more. I found
  a link to this pseudo session report from Fantasy Flight Games about an upcoming
  non-collectible card game called Frenzy.  What makes this game different is the
  real-time aspect:  The key to Frenzy is the real-time aspect. There are no turns
  or order to play. You just lay down the cards as fast as your attention can keep
  up. The great thing about this is the game has just enought things going on to strain
  your mind, but not so much that you can't keep track.  Sounds pretty cool to me. 
  The website indicates this will have a December release, but I don't believe it
  is available yet."
