excerpt: 'Thursday evening was the official start of Christmas vacation for me.  I
  made the 2 hour drive out the coast yesterday afternoon and arrived to find a houseful
  of family and friends. This is a great crowd to try out some gaming with, and folks
  jumped at the chance to play Union Pacific.  I had to refresh myself on the rules
  but we were in full swing within about 15 minutes. Geoff took a strategy of diversified
  ownership of about 6–7 lines and managed to finish 1st or 2nd in all of his holdings
  throughout the first two scorings, putting him squarely in the lead with me in second
  place.  Karen and I shared / alternated ownership of a few lines and held our own,
  but in the end Geoff pulled off the victory.  Next it was time to bring out some
  of my ancient Magic: the Gathering decks and have a three-way match with Jacob and
  Matthew.  Jacob played a green growth / enchantment / regeneration deck that was
  too slow to get started – he was shy creatures throughout the game.  Matthew played
  our favorite deck, a black/white denial deck with a healthy dose of Hypnotic Specters,
  Mindtwists, and some big flying creatures like the Serra Angel and Sengir Vampire. 
  I played a white weenie deck with a bunch of banding / first strike white creatures,
  and a small dose of red for direct damage.   Matthew played his deck well and managed
  to get out the angel and vampire, making short work of Jacob and me.  We then got
  a group of six to play some Time’s Up, easily my favorite party game right now. 
  Teams were Julie/Karen, Dave/Mike, and Chris/Geoff.  Geoff and I had a good thing
  going, maintaining a solid lead into the final round.  We slowed down a bit as we
  played the final no-words round but held off the charge from Julie and Karen to
  pull out the victory.  Finally, we rounded up the whole crowd for a game of Wits
  and Wagers, the new party game from Eagle and North Star Games.  I plan to post
  a complete review next week, but suffice it to say that everyone had a blast and
  there was much laughter and groaning.  Average rating from everyone was about 7–8. 
  A good sign was everyone asking to play a second game immediately after the first. '
