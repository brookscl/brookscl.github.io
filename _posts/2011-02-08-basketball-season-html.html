<p>I haven't written much about basketball season lately and given how much of my family life revolves around it this time of year it is at least worth an aside mention. </p>

<p>Jacob is playing as a solid, consistent post player on the JV high school team. He doesn't score many points but is an impact defensive player and a good rebounder. He's been over 6' tall for 2 years and is coming to grips with the fact that being 6'1" was a lot more meaningful as a 14 year old than it is at 16. The season is about 2 weeks from ending and then it will be on to track where he plans to focus on the javelin and high jump. </p>

<p>Matthew is playing in his final youth season on an 8th grade classic/select team. He's been with most of his teammates for 4 or more years and they really enjoy playing together. Hard to believe Julie and I are counting the days until the end of youth sports for the boys.</p>
