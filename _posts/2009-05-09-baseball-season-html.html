excerpt: " The baseball seasons starts with a bang this weekend with the Sherwood
  Federal JBO tournament. Jacob is playing in the senior fed tournament, Matthew the
  junior fed. Jacob's team had a great start tonight with a 14-2 win over Beaverton,
  with Jacob going 2-3 with an RBI and run scored. Unfortunately, he didn't score
  on the pictured play above where he tried to advance on a wild pitch. Mt. Hood in
  the background - yes, clear skies have returned to Oregon."
