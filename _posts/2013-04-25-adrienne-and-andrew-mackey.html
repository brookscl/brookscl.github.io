<p>We went to Florida last weekend to celebrate the marriage of my niece Adrienne and her new husband Andrew. Saw some family I hadn't seen for a <em>long</em> time and generally had a wonderful time. Also played 36 holes of crappy golf. There are some great muni courses in the Melbourne / Cocoa Beach area. </p>
<p>The photo above? Well, it was just a tad windy for the beach wedding and hearty sons Jacob and Matthew were assigned the duty of bracing the wedding arch. After the ceremony we got this nice pic of Adrienne and Andrew holding the arch for the Jacob and Matthew pose. </p>
<p>Congrats Mr. and Mrs. Mackey!</p>
