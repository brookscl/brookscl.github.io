excerpt: "  Jacob, Matthew, and I are already registered for a full conference at
  Gen Con this year.  Last year Jacob and I spent 3 days there and Matthew joined
  us for a morning.  We'll see how much time Matthew is interested in spending there
  this year. Rather than sign up for a lot of the pre-scheduled board gaming events,
  we will most likely rely on generic tickets this year and focus on pick-up gaming
  at Game Base 7.  I'm also going to try and do a better job of coordinating with
  other spielfrieks out there that are interested in hooking up, so please let me
  know via email or a comment if you plan on attending."
