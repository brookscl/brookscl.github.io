excerpt: 'This was a great summer for scouting (of the Boy and Cub variety).  I managed
  to spend about 3–4 days each at Jacob’s and Matthew’s summer camps and we finished
  off the season with an outstanding backpacking trip. In early July I joined Jacob’s
  new Boy Scout troop at Camp Pioneer near Mt Jeffereson.  This was the first week
  in operation this year, meaning we had small numbers and a great counselor / scout
  ratio.  The camp surounds a small alpine lake and is geared towards a more primitive,
  old-time scouting experience than most camps you see these days (like Camp Meriwether).  Jacob
  had a blast and got right into the spirit of camp.  He made significant progress
  towards the 1st Class rank (he’ll get that in September or October) and earned four
  merit badges.  Despite their best efforts, the flock of mosquitos weren’t enough
  to ruin the experience for the adults and kids.  Matthew attended Gilbert Ranch
  at Butte Creek not far from the Silverton area near the end of July.  This was his
  first resident camping experience and it was a great fit for him.  This is a camp
  with a cowboy theme that includes a lot of farm and equestrian focus.  He particularly
  enjoyed getting up at 5:45am to go feed and groom the animals.  We capped off the
  summer with a short backpacking trip out to Bay Ocean spit near Tillamook, OR. 
  I brought Matthew along with the Boy Scout troop and he was easily able to keep
  up with the big kids.  This is a perfect introductory backpack trip – about 2–3
  mile hike in with a decently well established camp site near the bay and a short
  walk away from the ocean and south jetty. '
