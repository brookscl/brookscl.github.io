excerpt: 'Perhaps a new tradition?  We''ll see... Last night Jacob, Matthew and I
  played our two favorite cooperative games (ok, our only two): Lord of the Rings
  and Vanished Planet. Lord of the Rings ranks as one of our favorite family games,
  and is the game responsible for getting me back into the gaming hobby.  It was a
  gift from Julie''s brother for Christmas 2002, and after doing some searching on
  the web for this Knizia guy I eventually found BoardGameGeek and the rest is history.         Jacob,
  Matthew and I work our way through Shelob''s lair. We always play on the easy setting
  with Sauron starting as far away as possible.  This session played very quickly
  with the fellowship racing to Mt. Doom and destroying the ring, matching our best
  ever score of 79. Jacob requested that we play Vanished Planet, the cooperative
  game released in 2003.  This game doesn''t have the best reputation, but we quite
  like it.  My biggest complaint is the fiddly nature of the game and lack of consistency
  in colors and symbols.  A group that plans well together can outperform those that
  play this as multi-player solitaire.         Jacob, Matthew, and I try and save
  the universe from the creature. In this session we were victorious, saving the universe
  with about 1-2 creature growths to spare.  We only played with a single creature
  growth card in the event deck; next time we''ll try 2 or 3. Oh yeah, we finally
  broke out The Amazing Labyrinth last weekend.  This is a classic Ravensburger game,
  and I wanted to teach Julie so that she could play it during the school gaming program
  at Archer Glen elementary.  Lately they''ve been playing Blokus and The Legend of
  Landlock, so this should add some nice variety.         Matthew and I wait seemingly
  forever for Julie to get off the phone and make her move. I like the game, though
  it is a bit long.  Fortunately it is easy to shorten the game by using fewer treasures. 
  Also, Julie had a problem in class with some students peeking ahead into their treasure
  stacks, so she will probably have players draw from a common pile the next time
  she plays.  Then she can easily control the time as well by choosing a smaller target
  like 4 treasures.'
