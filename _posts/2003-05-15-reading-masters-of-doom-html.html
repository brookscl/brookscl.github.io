excerpt: "     I picked up the book Masters     of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire
  and Transformed Pop Culture by David     Kushner this week while in Columbus.  This
  is a great book - right up there with The     Soul of a New Machine and Show-stopper!. 
  \    Having lived through this era (Wolfenstein 3D to Doom to Quake), it is especially
  \    nostalgic to recount the impact Carmack and Romero had on our culture.  The
  first     time I ever played Doom deathmatch was actually on an SGI box while working
  at Wright     Labratory for the USAF doing cockpit research."

Transformed Pop Culture</a></em><br />
by David Kushner this week while in Columbus. This is a great book - right up<br />
there with <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316491977">The Soul of a New<br />
Machine</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0029356717">Show-<br />
