excerpt: 'My goal is to finish my posts on Europe before my next trip to Europe. Nothing
  like setting the bar high. We finished our tour of Belgium near the French border
  and drove through the countryside to our first stop in Reims (or Rheims) to break
  up the drive a bit. We started with a champagne tour at Taittinger, arriving without
  knowing when tours would run but fortunately we had another English speaking couple
  show up that allowed us to supersede their previously scheduled French language
  tour. We did have to wait in the lobby for a while to make sure nobody else would
  show up.  The tour was fascinating - we went deep into the cellars and witnessed
  a great overview of the process, plus some tasty sampling afterwards.  That evening
  we wandered around the heart of Reims, including a visit to the spectacular Notre
  Dame de Reims cathedral. This cathedral has been a participant in many historical
  events, including coronations of many kings and battles during WWI.  Early the next
  morning we departed our hotel to enter Paris. My navigation skills were a bit lacking
  as we missed a key turnoff on the south central loop around the city and we managed
  to get stuck on the freeway for several miles and unfortunately had to pay a tool
  to make our way back. Dave and I dropped everyone off at the hotel to check in so
  that we could head into town towards Les Invalides to return the car. We lucked
  into a fueling station near the drop-off and hopped on the metro to head south and
  meet up with the family.  Unfortunately the catacombs were closed for renovation!
  Julie of course had a backup plan - the Musée de l’Orangerie where we could see
  some of Monet''s finest works plus pick up our museum pass - an amazing deal if
  you are spending a few days in Paris. Julie was our guide throughout the Paris stay
  - it was rare to see her without the Rick Steves book in hand.  Next up was the
  hike up Champs Élysées from the Place de la Concorde (with obelisk) to the Arc de
  Triomphe. The weather was cool but clear and the skies a deep blue.  Except when
  the thunderstorm hit us and we had to hide away in the Grand Palais. One day into
  our Paris trip the museums were starting to wear on the two most likely suspects:
  Dave and Matthew. All the more reason to have a museum pass and allow us to hop
  and hop out without worrying about getting a full value from a single visit.  We
  enjoyed stopping in a few of the shops along the Champs - most impressive were the
  concept cars in the Renault Peugeot (I knew that! but thanks George...) show room.  And
  of course, the culmination of the walk is the Arc de Triomphe. We climbed to the
  top - within a 24 hour period we would climb the Arc, the Eiffel [as far as we could),
  and Notre Dame - for a spectacular view of the city.  Note: this is not perfect
  scale - view of the tower from the Arc.  We originally planned to climb the tower
  later in the week, but with the weather clear and our legs fresh we decided to take
  advantage of our location and climb it. We approached from the Trocadéro and got
  a few nice shots of the illuminated tower. Climbing as high as we could followed
  by the final elevator lift was a smart move and probably saved us an hour of waiting
  in line at the base for tickets and an elevator.  We finished the day at a brasserie
  near our hotel, which was most notable for possibly the worst piece of sausage any
  of us have ever tasted. Lesson learned, we''ll stick to sausages from Germany and
  England in the future. '
