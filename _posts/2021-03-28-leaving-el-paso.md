This post is as much as test of image posting workflow with my new static 
site as it is a real post. Still, we leave El Paso in the coming week to 
embark on a month-long adventure in the southwest, mainly Nevada and Utah. 
If I can get my posting workflow streamlined and automated you'll see a lot 
more photos.

Matthew and I were able to play a final round of golf here, playing at the 
sunrise course at Underwood Golf Course, which is affiliated with Fort Bliss.
