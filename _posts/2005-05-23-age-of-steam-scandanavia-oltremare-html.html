excerpt: " Matthew's baseball tournament this weekend was cancelled, leaving some
  time free on Saturday to join the RipCity folks for some gaming on Saturday.  Eric
  was hosting (read his session report) and though we were expecting four to show
  up, Mike got hung up at work so it left us with just three (including Dave).  We
  batted around a few ideas, but when Eric suggested one of the Age of Steam expansion
  maps (Scandinavia) Dave and I gave our approval.  Age of Steam apparently isn't
  the best game with three - I wouldn't know as I've only played twice and both times
  with at least four players.  This is a smallish map so seemed like a good choice
  for our small group.         The Scandinavia map for Age of Steam.  The white lines
  are sea routes and cost $6 to build. The Scandinavia map introduces a few new special
  rules that make sense in this seafaring area:  Sea routes are dedicated links between
  cities separated by small water distances.  These behave just like normal routes,
  but rather than being built with track hexes players can simply claim them when
  building at a cost of $6. There is a new action choice called Ferry, which allows
  a player to move one good from one ocean-side city to another during transportation
  of goods.  This makes it much easier to transport goods around the map, allowing
  for a tiny bit more chaos than the original game.         Eric (green), Dave (yellow),
  and I (black) about midway through the game. The game was close in the early going,
  but Dave pulled away significantly around mid-game, pulling out several 4 and 5-segment
  shipmens over consecutive turns.  I kept myself close only by being a bit more conservative
  in issuing shares, but Dave was just too strong and pulled out the victory.  Scoring
  was fairly evenly distributed, with Eric finishing in third. Next up was Oltremare,
  a game I had been hoping to play since back in January.  Eric did a fine job explaining
  the rules, calling out some similarities with Bohnanza while explaining the specifics. 
  \        The mini board provided with Oltremare.  This is mostly a card game - the
  board is there to provide a scoring track plus a depiction of the travel routes
  players follow to pick up special tokens. It took the whole game for me to start
  to figure out the economics of card management.  There are a number of conflicting
  priorities in the game that need to be balanced: you want to collect the right sequences
  of cards in your cargo deck to score points in the endgame, but those same sequences
  of cards do not always provide the best mid-game payout.  In particular, you need
  to keep a steady flow of cards coming into your hand (or at least plan for an ebb
  and flow - I had too much ebb).  Eric won with a healthy advantage, I finished second
  place.  Scores were 60-51-40.  I look forward to playing this a few more times -
  should be a good lunchtime play."
