excerpt: 'Saturday was our one day off and a chance to see some interesting sites
  in Israel.  Jerusalem was on the top of my list, plus I contacted Yehuda Berlinger
  of the Jerusalem Strategy Gaming Club and arranged for a face-to-face visit.  Our
  morning started with a 9am departure from Tel Aviv to make the 45-60 minute drive
  to Jerusalem.  We found a nice place to stop for some pastries and coffee along
  the way (not sure where we were, but there was an IDF military museum with a tank
  static display right near the store). We drove straight to the Old City and parked
  near the Zion Gate (no particular reason - the parking was just easier there). 
  Jerusalem is striking as you enter it, even the newer portions.  The city planners
  work hard to keep the old city look and feel, and many of the buildings have a tan
  stone facade.  Erich and I opted to go it alone without a tour guide, or rather,
  Erich volunteered to be my tour guide as he had visited about 2 months prior. Our
  first stop was the Christian quarter and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.  There
  was quite a bit of activity here, clearly across a wide range of Christian denominations.         The
  Greek Orthodox chapel in the Church. It would have been beneficial to have a guide
  or at least a detailed guidebook, as I probably missed a number of the more revered
  locations in the church.         The dome within the Church. The most interesting
  parts of the Old City (to me) were the plethora of markets and shops, mostly Arab,
  featuring touristy goods and some very decent food.  I picked up a nice silver necklace
  for Julie and Erich and I sat down for a rest and some lunch (humus, falafel, pita,
  etc.).         A market within the Arab quarter. Erich and I both wanted to visit
  the Dome of the Rock, but unfortunately that wasn''t an option on Saturday.  We
  did visit the Wailing Wall, but took no photos as it was still Shabbat.         Some
  ruins in the Old City just beyond the Wailing Wall. At around 1pm, Erich and left
  the Old City for our car and ventured up to the Mount of Olives, famous for its
  wonderful view of the city.  At the base of the Mount of Olives is the Garden of
  Gethsemane.  The views were spectacular from there, affording us our best view so
  far of the Dome of the Rock.         The view from the Mount of Olves.  You can
  see the ruins pictured in the above photo in the middle left of this shot.  You
  can also see the Jewish cemetery at the bottom of the photo         Erich was keen
  to ride what is probably the only camel in Jerusalem.  He didn''t actually ride
  it - he just paid to get on it, stand up, then sit back down. Next it was time to
  try and navigate our way to Yehuda''s home.  Our drive away from the Mount of Olives
  took us to an interesting surprise in East Jerusalem:         The security wall
  being built to encompass East Jerusalem. There were quite a few (10-15) IDF soldiers
  patrolling this end of the wall. Yehuda gave us some fine directions from Tel Aviv,
  but that''s not where we were coming from and Jerusalem is, shall we say, a bit
  difficult to get around.  Erich has a fine memory though and remembered some street
  signs to a common landmark from Yehuda''s directions, and we were able to find our
  way there right on time for our 3pm arrival. 3pm on Saturday is still right smack
  in the middle of Shabbat for Yehuda, and we had discussed ahead of time what this
  specifically meant for his family.  We decided to take a short stroll to see the
  area surrounding his neighborhood, and he took us to a beautiful park overlooking
  most of Jerusalem.  We returned from our walk and jumped right into some gaming
  (you can also read his session report).  First up was a playtest of Yehuda''s prototype
  cardgame.  This is a fine little game themed on learning eletricity safety (sounds
  right out of KC''s playbook!) that involves collecting a set of numbered cards,
  where cards are generally purchased in auctions.  I''ve simplified it a bit but
  don''t want to give too much away.  The theme needs some work but the mechanics
  are solid and Yehuda should continue to develop this one. Michael and his son Elijah
  arrived and we decided on El Grande.  This is a game I love but get to play way
  too infrequently; in fact, this was only my third play.  Erich, new to these types
  of boardgames, was a quick study and was in contention for the entire game.  Yehuda
  made a huge comeback in the second scoring round, going for a wide range of second-
  and third-place showings rather than concentrating on controlling provinces.  This
  was in contrast to Erich''s strategy: focus on controlling 2-3 valuable provinces
  at any cost.  Between the last two scoring rounds, Erich (I think - it might have
  been Michael) bought the card that scores first place across all the provinces. 
  This helped Erich the most, helped me a bit, but crushed Yehuda as he was not in
  first in any of the provinces.  This turned out to be the difference in the game,
  allowing me to eke out the victory with Erich a fairly close second.  Erich loved
  the game and asked where he could purchase it back in Portland... perhaps another
  closet gamer drawn out? Next up was a splendid dinner with Yehuda and his family. 
  Their hospitality was unsurpassed and it made our journey feel like we were visiting
  old friends down the street. Last up was a four-player game of Puerto Rico with
  Yehuda, his wife Rachel, and friend Nadine (Erich sat this one out to learn).  I
  didn''t know what I was getting myself into - these folks are sharks!  They''ve
  clearly played this game enough to know a wide range of strategies, something I
  clearly have not done (nor do I ever expect to).  Yehuda (aka Jon) won a fairly
  close game.  He was kind enough to leave my score off of his session report.         Rachel,
  Erich, Nadine, and Yehuda playing Puerto Rico. All in all, our visit was a great
  day of site seeing and friendship.  We returned to Hasharon in Herzliya that evening
  around 11pm we quite a bit of work to do in prep for the next day, but it was worth
  it and I''m glad we took the time to visit Jerusalem.'
