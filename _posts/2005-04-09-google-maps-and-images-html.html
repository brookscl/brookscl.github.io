excerpt: 'Google Maps continues to get even more interesting.  They recently added
  satellite imagery to the maps, adding a much-needed feature that helps bring context
  to online maps.  Google still needs improvement though: the map address database
  still has some significant omissions and inaccuracies. One interesting past-time:
  looking at images of the different places I''ve lived during my lifetime.'
