excerpt: I had to work, but Julie, Jacob, and Matthew spent most of Friday in Lincoln
  City, the closest coastal town to our home in Sherwood.  The summer is ticking away,
  and Julie realized she had not yet taken the time to spend a day playing in the
  sand and surf.  The Oregon coast is a special place unlike most in the world - it
  isn't a place to swim or sunbathe since the water is mostly too cold and warm sunny
  days are few and far between.  It is a place to play and gaze at the scenic landscapes. 
  Jacob and Matthew mostly enjoy digging in the sand, building walls, castles, moats,
  and burying each other.  We recommend avoiding the beaches on the main highway 101
  drag in Lincoln City - they tend to be overcrowded and a bit dirty.  Instead head
  north of town, past the casino, to Road's End State Recreation Site.  Of course
  you'll need to eat some seafood as well - your best bet is the Dory Cove Restaurant,
  also at Road's End.  Your best bets are the clam chowder and the battered halibut.
