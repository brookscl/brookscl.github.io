<p>So far it has been a wonderful family Christmas with much gift giving and cats rising and crashing on catnip.  The morning started with an unusual early waking by the boys at 8:00am and revealing of the stockings.  Socks, candy, and a (professional) Belgian waffle maker were the highlights. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/sets/72157632336184605/">More photos on my Flickr set</a>.</p>

<p>We gave the cats some super-concentrated black tar catnip ball that resulted in a crazy Christmas show by the cats.  They were fighting over access to the ball and Gabby ended up rolling around with it for five minutes licking it non-stop.</p>

<p>The result was almost a trance-like state for both cats.  Maybe the new kitty sweaters were also restricting blood-flow to their heads.  Either way it had us all laughing.</p>

<p>Julie made up waffles for all of us with tasty fruit topping.</p>

<p>One of my stocking gifts for Julie was four tickets to the first showing of Les Mis√©rables here in Sherwood so we are off to the show!  Later tonight will be a tasty Christmas dinner with our close friends the Alleys.  <strong>Merry Christmas y'all!</strong></p>
