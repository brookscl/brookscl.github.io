excerpt: '  I traveled to Colorado Springs this week for a business trip, and had
  the  pleasure of spending an evening at Plenary Games headquarters with Angela Gaalema.
  I''ve been a gamer for most of my life, but have only recently become  engaged with
  the boardgaming world.  These games are indeed wonderful, but  it is clear to me
  that the reason this community is so vibrant is the people.   I spend way too much
  time on the road, but it is amazing how easy it has been to  hook up with folks
  in the gaming network no matter where I travel.  In the  Seattle area I managed
  to hook up with two guys in a brewpub for an evening of  gaming; a month later in
  Redmond I joined the crowd at  WizKids for a  great  session.  While in Providence,
  RI I had a  chance encounter with Lawrence  Whalen of Face2Face games.  And of course
  right in my hometown of Portland  there''s a great presence of regular gaming groups,
  like PortlandGamers and the  crowd  at Benjamin''s. Angela was very quick to answer
  my email letting her know I would be in  Colorado Springs and was kind enough to
  invite me to her home and company  headquarters.  I purchased  Fresh Fish recently
  directly from Plenary , so I  was very curious to see how she manages her operations
  (and of course to play  some games). My visit started with a tour of her warehouse,
  which sits on top of a  recently covered indoor pool.  Angela assembles all of her
  shipments (from  the source components) by hand, and she has certainly been very
  busy lately  keeping up with her orders (I think I recall her mentioning that she
  shipped  around 250 copies this week).  Her warehouse is full of big empty boxes
  for  shipping, unsorted stacks of tiles, wooden bits (yes, including the often  maligned
  red/orange ones), game boxes, inserts, rules, and game boards. I asked  many questions
  about the business and Angela was extremely forthcoming about the  challenges she
  faced getting the game shipped in such short order - the project  didn''t even start
  until around October of last year.  She is clearly  envious of the higher quality
  printing available from German printers - even  though it would be cheaper for her
  to send her printing overseas, she is  (understandably) unwilling to give up the
  control and predictability of working  with American printers.  In any case, her
  first offering is a great first  effort and I look forward to seeing the future
  releases from Plenary. Angela then showed me her game collection (allowing me to
  further rationalize  my meager collection and feel safe that I''m not nearly as
  much of a gaming geek  as my wife might think) and we spent some time talking about
  her recent trip to  the Gathering of Friends.  Then we spent some time gaming. Balloon
  Cup Having read about this game for some time on spielfrieks, I was very  eager
  to try this (still hard to find) offering by Stephen Glenn and Kosmos/Rio  Grande
  Games.  I don''t get the theme and how it relates to the game (well,  I guess I
  do, but it is not a natural linkage), but I think the game is  fantastic.  In this
  two-player card game, players compete for color bits  that vary in rarity - if you
  accumulate a certain number of bits (smaller number  for the rarer bits) of a certain
  color, you win the corresponding trophy card  for that color.  Win 3 of the 5 trophy
  cards, and you win the game.   At any given time, there are 4 landscape cards on
  the table with 1, 2, 3, or 4  bits of varying colors on each one.  Depending on
  the card, each player is  trying to accumulate the lowest or highest score of a
  set of cards matching the  colored bits on the landscape card.  So if a card has
  a "high" goal with a  red and blue bit on it, then each player is trying to lay
  down the highest  combination of a red and blue card to claim those bits.  Player
  interaction  and disruption comes from the ability to play cards on your opponents
  side of  the table (e.g., play a high card when the goal is to achieve a low score).
  Angela got off to a flying start in our game, and while I managed to claw my  way
  back to respectability, she easily won the game.  This is a fantastic  2-player
  game that I will be sure to pick up as soon as I can find it.  Funagain  claims
  that they will have it in stock by the end of May. Clans Clans is an interesting
  game.  It has a theme of nomadic groups that  consolidate to form groups and villages. 
  There is a hidden element to the  scoring in that players do not know what color
  (tribe) each other player is  trying to push forward, but this game mostly plays
  like an abstract strategy  game with a nice theme and pretty bits.  Angela beat
  me handily in this  game, but I can''t say I was terribly engaged - a bit too abstract
  for me.   Not a game I plan to add to my collection.  Kupferkessel (Copper Pot Company)
  This is a beautiful two-player card game - the theme revolves around wizards  trying
  to accumulate ingredients for spells.  There is a memory component  to the game,
  as each player is trying to consolidate on a few sets of  ingredients - players
  in general are rewarded for collecting multiple instances  of a particular ingredient
  and penalized for getting only one of a specific  type.  The catch is the players
  are not permitted to inspect their stack of  collected ingredients, so it is important
  to memorize what has been collected.   There is a small degree of player interaction
  - there are certain cards that can  force the top card of the opponent''s ingredient
  deck to be discarded.    I finally managed to win a game against Angela - this game
  played very quickly,  and I enjoyed the mechanic and loved the theme and artwork. 
  I''ll  definitely play this again and may consider adding it to my collection. Mush
  Angela wanted to try this older game by Alan Moon - in fact, she was given  this
  by Alan Moon himself at the recent Gathering of Friends.  Mush is  essentially a
  roll-and-move racing game set in the theme of dogsled racing in  Alaska.  I''m not
  a huge fan of racing games, and the mechanic felt very  clichéd - players can decide
  to rest or move (or even press their dogs after  they''ve moved).  The harder players
  push their dogs, the slower they will  ultimately go.  I won this again, but we
  were both eager to get it over  with.  Nice theme, but not my cup of tea. Puerto
  Rico It was pretty late (12:15am or so) by this time, and I was preparing to go  when
  I mentioned how much I liked Puerto Rico.  I''ve only played about 4  times, but
  I like the game enough that I''m sure I could play at least daily (I  really need
  to start playing on BSW  - my handle is CaptainCaveman in case you care).  Angela
  offered to play me  using the two-player variant where each player plays two separate
  boards.   I''m still trying to grasp some of the strategic subtleties of this game,
  but I  had a blast losing to Angela (she claims to have logged over 300 BSW games
  last  year).  '
