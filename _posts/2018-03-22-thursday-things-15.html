<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2320" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/03/Matthew-and-Chris-small.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Might be our last visit from Matthew in a while! He and roommate Chris were in town for spring break, and we tried to forecast when Matthew might be home again and couldn’t think of a a future date! He’s finishing his junior year at West Point and has a full calendar ahead, plus we are in NY for the summer. The photo above is Matthew and his roommate.</li>
<li><a href="https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/">Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself</a> – Every company will have the good and the bad. Google’s relentless “meritocracy” (I put that in quotes because they aspire for that but like every company, struggle to realize it <em>and</em> struggle with different dimensions of merit) can alienate what might be the best and brightest.</li>
<li><a href="http://area21.site/2018/03/12/rip-city-con-day-6-a-grand-tactical-affair/">Rip City Con Day 6 – A Grand (Tactical) Affair</a> – More of a friendly service reminder that my friend Doug is back in the blogging business and wrote up our gaming retreat. This article is about our play of <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194078/operation-mercury-invasion-crete">Operation Mercury</a>. I <em>loved</em> playing the GTS system and look forward to more play in the future.</li>
<li><a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/2017-behind-the-scenes-stakeholder-report-for-stonemaier-games/">2017 Behind-the-Scenes Stakeholder Report for Stonemaier Games</a> – My most admired gaming company, not just for the quality of their (his) productions but also the business leadership and transparency of Jamey Stegmaier. I wrote a similar article, albeit on a much smaller scale, over 12 years ago on the <a href="http://pdxgaming.blogspot.com/2005/10/economics-of-havoc.html">economics of Havoc</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/americas-opioid-epidemic.html">The Poison We Pick</a> – Read this and perhaps your perspective on what are truly arbitrary legal (and moral) distinctions surrounding the various substances we consume and inject.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2321" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/03/Cul-An-Ti-small.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Julie, Matthew, Chris, and I enjoyed some Irish music and dancing on the night before St. Patty's day. A friend was dancing to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/culanti/">Cul An Ti</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/12/592362147/first-listen-the-decemberists-i-ll-be-your-girl">First Listen: The Decemberists, ‘I’ll Be Your Girl’</a> – This one is a hit! Now available on your favorite streaming services, this album is in heavy rotation for me right now. Favorites: Severed and Once in my Life. I told Julie yesterday that this has echoes of 1980s pop, namely Tears for Fears.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/08/590957789/first-listen-mount-eerie-now-only">First Listen: Mount Eerie, ‘Now Only’</a> – Not really my thing, but I’m glad I listened through it as it did grow on me after initial revulsion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Doug and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27969974">Pax Renaissance</a> in a learning game for him. I’m getting better at teaching this wonderful game, but still have room to improve. Doug won with a nice combo and the game lasted about 2 hours. This one will go out to NY with me.</li>
<li>Julie and I <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27986556">played Jaipur</a> while eating dinner and drinking beer as we awaited Matthew and roommate Chris near the airport.</li>
<li>We played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28081918">Codenames</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28082126">Coup</a> (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28082030">twice</a>) with Matthew and Chris during their visit. Coup was a nice find in the library at a coffee spot near Gleneden Beach.</li>
<li>Julie and I <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/28086174">played Lanterns: The Harvest Festival</a> while enjoying happy hour at the Salishan Lodge. Julie pulled this off the prize table at the gaming retreat and I’m glad she did.</li>
</ul>
