excerpt: 'Sunday we joined the Ken and Brandon for some D&D in the afternoon (our
  ongoing Forgotten Realms campaign) and some brief boardgaming in the evening. Looking
  at my game collection for unplayed 2–player games, I discovered A House Divided,
  the light American Civil War wargame published most recently by Phalanx.  I won
  this at a the Rainy Day Games auction a few months ago (I think Dave sold it??). 
  Jacob, Brandon, and Matthew decided to try another unplayed game that I picked up
  at Goodwill a while back: the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone Game. The boys
  played this cold out of the box, teaching the rules to themselves and struggling
  through what is a needlessly complex rulebook.  There are actually 6 different games
  in the box (6 3/4 if you count the final random card draw for the end-game); a couple
  of them involve some skill but most are very luck driven.         Matthew, Brandon,
  and Jacob working through the rules. They called for help for the rules to the last
  sub-game – I read the rules 3 or 4 times before finally figuring out what the designer
  must have meant.  In fact, Ken and I finished a (shortened) game of A House Divided
  well before the boys got through this game.  Comments after the game included “I
  don’t want to play that again,” “we should sell this for $0.99 at a garage sale,”
  and “we should give this back to Goodwill.”  Anyone want to trade? Ken and I had
  a much more positive experience with A House Divided.  This is a very light, somewhat
  abstract strategic level depiction of the Civil War.  I say abstract because of
  the simplified movement system, which is essentially city-to-city via roads, rivers,
  or rails.  This game has about the same complexity level as the Columbia block games
  and even shares some similar mechanics for combat resolution.           Ken studying
  his options as the confederate player. There’s a lot to like about this game.  I
  was able to read the rules in 30 minutes before Ken arrived and teach him in about
  15 minutes – the basic game is very easy to learn.  Movement choices are constrained
  in each player’s turn by a D6 die roll to determine the number of available “marches”
  (2–6 per turn per player, first turn each player only gets 2 marches).  There’s
  some quirkiness to the victory conditions that can lead to some odd strategies,
  especially since we decided to end after 10 turns while 8 turns into the game (this
  was about 2 hours into the game).  Ken wisely started chasing around claiming union
  cities to try and get the victory points (via maximum army size) to swing in his
  favor.  The games seems fairly well balanced as well, offering interesting choices
  to both players even with the basic rules.  I look forward to playing again through
  the entire campaign, perhaps with the advanced rules that introduce supply and command. 
  Definite thumbs up and if you like games like Hammer of the Scots and Liberty you’ll
  probably enjoy this one.  My one complaint in relation to the block games is that
  I found there to be too few dice rolled in combat.  This may seem like an odd complaint,
  but since there’s no “strength” of units in this system (only firepower) Ken and
  I often found ourselves rolling a single D6 against each other, waiting to see who
  would roll a 1 or 2 first.  When a unit is damaged, it automatically recovers back
  to full strength at the end of combat.  I prefer the block system where units “remember”
  their damage and can be restored through a supply process.'
