excerpt: 'Mikko  has an interesting post on Books  About Games.  It reminded me of
  a fantasy book I read in the early  1980''s called Hobgoblin, which  was about a
  teenager that gets caught up in a role-playing game similar to  Dungeons and Dragons. 
  One interesting aspect was the game system: it was a  hybrid role playing and card
  game that looked similar to Magic: the Gathering (10+ years before  it was published
  of course).'
