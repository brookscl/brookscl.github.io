excerpt: 'Apologies for turning these Europe posts into a drawn out series of publications
  not unlike a pulp serial series. Life has been busy again and blogging usually is
  the first thing to go when priorities compete for my attention. I already posted
  about the non-Bulge related tourism we did in Belgium, so what remains is three
  posts on our visits to various significant locations related to the Battle of the
  Bulge from December 1944 - January 1945. Bulge 101 My readers range from folks who
  know little more than that the Battle of the Bulge may have happened in WWII, to
  those that know a lot more than I. My deep(er) study began about a year ago after
  some email conversations with Tim Cockit and Max Michael where they provided recommendations
  after a few trips they made to the Ardennes. My primary sources were:    Battle:
  the Story of the Bulge, by John Toland.    Hitler''s Ardennes Offensive: the German
  View of the Battle of the Bulge, by Danny Parker.    A Tour of the Bulge Battlefield,
  by William Cavanagh.  The first two were easy to read overviews of the battle from
  the Allied and German perspectives, while the Tour book is the indispensable guide
  book that I brought on the trip. You can fill in some more details by reading the
  fine Wikipedia article on the Bulge. By the fall of 1944 the allies had resigned
  themselves to waiting out the winter along the German Westwall (Siegfried Line)
  after heavy fighting around Aachen and the Hürtgen Forest. The Allied supply lines
  were over-extended and most divisions were significantly below their full strength
  levels. The result was a focus on stabilizing existing lines as much as possible
  and awaiting warmer weather and stronger supply before the final push to Berlin.Hitler
  had no plans to sit still and wait for the Allied advance. Starting in September
  Hitler began formulating his plan code-named Wacht Am Rhein (watch on the Rhine)
  an assault through the Ardennes region of Belgium and Luxembourg designed to split
  the Allied troops in half by marching to Antwerp. The objective was to isolate the
  troops under Montgomery to the north from the rest of the Allied forces in France
  as well as Patton''s army marching from the south. Hitler originally planned to
  launch his offensive in late November, but a combination of delays from his Generals
  and too-nice weather delayed the assault until December 16, 1944. For the allies,
  the Ardennes front was the "Ghost Front" where soldiers went to get away from the
  real action and where new recruits learned the ropes on patrols will little chance
  for real confrontation. For over two months the Allies had mostly rested and stared
  at the other side and avoided conflict. The Ardennes front stretched from Echternach,
  Luxembourg in the south to Monschau, Germany in the north. Before daylight on December
  16 the Germans opened with artillery fire and shortly thereafter infantry in white
  snow gear marched on the allied lines. Tanks followed the infantry through the ghost
  front, and it took the allies some time to realize that this was a general assault
  and not isolated incursions on the line.          Uploaded with plasq''s Skitch!  The
  German offensive succeeded in pushing a bulge in the American line, pushing near
  Dinant and Namur on the Meuse River but running out of time, supply (mainly petrol)
  were eventually stopped by the Allied forces. The tide turned around Christmas 1944
  but the fighting in the battle would continue through the end of January with significant
  casualties on both sides well after the battle was lost by the Germans. This was
  a devastating battle for both sides - over 80,000 casualties for both armies with
  nearly 20,000 Americans killed. This was the largest pitched battle of the war for
  the Americans and the death toll surpassed any other engagement in the war. The
  Northern Shoulder: Monschau, Wallerscheid, and Hollerath  From the train station
  in Liege we set off for the village of Monschau which marks the northern edge of
  the German assault. Almost on cue, snow started falling as we worked our way up
  the 2 lane highway through the hills to the Belgium / Germany border. It was Easter
  Sunday and the road was full of families driving into the hills for cross country
  skiing and other wintry fun. Monschau was mostly spared in the battle - apparently
  General Model was fond of the historic latticed houses and wished to preserve them
  from destruction. This area was very active before the battle started with skirmishes
  occurring frequently in the area leading up to December 16. In the village of Höfen
  on the southern edge of Monschau we stopped at Gasthaus Schmiddem, a B&B nestled
  on the Rur river. This is where soldiers from the 395th Infantry of the 99th Infantry
  Division holed up to withstand the opening barrage of rockets and shelling that
  marked the start of the battle. Moving south through along the ridge highway marking
  the border, we stopped at a national park in the Schnee Eifel (now called Schneifel,
  Schnee == snow) about 100 yards from the Wahlerscheid road junction. This became
  known as Heartbreak Crossroads - American troops of the 9th Infantry Regiment (the
  "Manchus") had been engaged in a staggering assault on this fortress for several
  days leading up to the start of the Bulge. They captured the crossroads only to
  lose it with the opening assault of the Bulge, but they significantly slowed the
  advance as a result.  The crossroads today is little more than a west-bound junction
  into Belgium from the north-south highway in the Eifel. The Americans would finally
  retake this critical road junction in February 1945.  Next up was a stop in Hollerath
  to visit a local war memorial featuring a broken church bell found in the ruined
  church after the battle. One bunker in this village served as the forward command
  post of the 12th SS Hitlerjugend Panzer Division at the onset of the attack.  The
  weather was crisp and clear and the town was eerily quiet on this Easter Sunday.
  We entered the church as well and saw some beautiful modern stained glass.  Our
  last stop in the Eifel was to a picnic area south of Hollerath and was our most
  dramatic visualization of what the terrain may have looked like during the war.
  This was the eastern-most point (the start) of Rollbahn (highway) A, the panzer
  assault route leading west through Krinkelt-Rocherath across the Elsenborn Ridge
  to the Meuse River. From where we parked we could stare into the forest line marking
  the Belgian border where American troops were positioned at the start of the battle.
  The road into the forest was nothing more than a dirt trail in 1944, and as you
  can see the dragon''s teeth marking the Siegfried Line still remain in force.  This
  was about all of the stopping I could cajole the group into for the day, so it was
  time to make the final scenic drive into La Roche en Ardennes, our home for the
  next three nights.  La Roche is probably most famous as one of the link-up points
  of the American and British forces towards the end of the battle shortly after the
  (re)liberation of La Roche in January 1945. There''s a nice Sherman tank near the
  town center, along with an British Achilles tank destroyer perched above town looking
  down on the river.   Travel'
