excerpt: The AGoTOnline team and Fantasy Flight Games reached an agreement this week
  that will allow the online site to continue operations.Â  Games already in progress
  will continue, but no new games will be created until some changes to the implementation
  are made. I'm thrilled that FFG worked constructively with the site maintainers
  to work out a reasonable solution for both parties.
