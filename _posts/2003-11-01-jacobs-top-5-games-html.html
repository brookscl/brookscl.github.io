excerpt: I gave Jacob and Matthew a project a few weeks ago - write down what your
  5 or 10 favorite games are with reasons.  I promised to publish them, so here is
  Jacob's list.  Star Wars Epic Duels I like this game because of the neat miniatures
  and the cool battling. It is fun with a lot of people. It is hard to choose who
  to attack.  Age of Mythology I like this game because there are a lot of strategies
  to choose. I learned that you can’t focus on one person to attack if you are playing
  with three or more players. That is why my dad won when we played for the first
  time.  Wallenstein I like this game because of the cool way to resolve battle. It
  is interesting because it almost equal. You have more of a chance of winning if
  you put more guys in though.   I’m The Boss! I like this game because of its neat
  way of negotiating. It is sometimes hard to get people to get into deals though.
  It’s hard to get a good cut of a share sometimes.  Tigris & Euphrates This game
  is fun because you have to have a lot of different victory cubes to win. I learned
  that you can’t build monuments too early in the game because your opponent could
  capture them immediately.
