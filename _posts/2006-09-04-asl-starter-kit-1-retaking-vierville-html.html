excerpt: 'I made significant progress on the burndown list over the past week – a
  combination of Goodwill donations, eBay sales, and focused gameplay has created
  a net swing of about 15 games. Jacob and I broke out my copy of Advanced Squad Leader
  (ASL) Starter Kit #1 today.  This is a second-chance for ASL and me, as my last
  attempt 3.5 years ago was less than satisfactory.  A lot has changed in those years,
  both in my personal gaming experience and in the ASL scene.  I’m fairly certain
  the Starter Kit wasn’t out at that time and in hindsight I don’t think the group
  we played with was really prepared to teach newbies like Ken and me. We played the
  1st scenario – Retaking Vierville (here’s a nice strategy discussion), using a combination
  of the rules, experimentation, and help from BGG and Saverese.org.  It was slow
  going at first, and I know for a fact we got several rules wrong:  We didn’t follow
  the “cower” rule when un-led doubles are rolled in an attack I know we screwed up
  defensive fire.  I think I need to hire a tutor on this one. We missed the rule
  that exact rolls on morale checks result in pins.  All this confusion without even
  using machine guns, vehicles, or two-story buildings!  It was quite enjoyable though
  – we we through with setup and initial rules explanation in about an hour, and the
  game took about 90–120 minutes.  Jacob played the Germans and got way too aggressive
  and close to my crack Americans, paying the price repeatedly.  It didn’t hurt that
  I rolled consecutive snake-eyes on point-black attacks on two separate stacks. 
  I won easily but we both walked away craving more, studying the next scenario, and
  excited to move on.  Now THAT feeling took me back to my days with the original
  Squad Leader – the combined anticipation of new rules, new stuff to play with, and
  a new historical scenario.  MMP was very wise with ASL SK #1 – they achieved their
  goal, which I assume is to ensnare new victims into the ASL hobby without overwhelming
  them with rules.  Boy, they could do without the acronyms though.  I need to check
  LOS before I make a DR during my PFPh with my MMC, but first I’ll check the TEM
  of his HS that barely survived a NMC during last DFPh.'
