excerpt: 'I recently made a commitment that I would post more about the role-playing
  game sessions I run.  These don’t happen frequently, but they are an important part
  of my family’s gaming world so it does make sense to talk about it from time to
  time. Sunday was a mostly open day, and I offered two choices to the boys – finish
  our saved game of Attack! or do a short session of Star Wars D20.  They immediately
  opted for some role-playing action, which put me in a bind as I had no planned adventure
  for their characters (a rogue and a Jedi).  Jacob was kind enough to do some research
  on the WOTC site and found a short one-shot adventure for us to play.  We used to
  play the old West End D6 Star Wars RPG (I played this in college and had all the
  materials) but switched to D20 once we became familiar with D&D 3.0.  It really
  is easier on the kids sticking to a single system like D20, though don’t think for
  a second that I’m not eager to try some other systems.  I already have Thirty and
  Cat in the queue to try and am also very interested in Polaris. This adventure turned
  out to be very short, almost too short, but was a nice way to get back into Star
  Wars and hopefully will lead to some more play in the near future.  I’ve got a big
  RPG session planned for next weekend so expect to see some more on our D&D campaign
  next Sunday or Monday. We drove over to the Rude’s home around 3pm – I offered to
  help Ken setup his new computer and the boys sat down with Brandon to play with
  his new XBox 360.  Ken and I managed to squeeze in a quick 2–player game of Attika.  There
  were few to no opportunities to connect our temples, so it became very clear about
  mid-game that the first player to build out his building set was going to win. 
  Attika is mostly about turn and resource efficiency and might be just a bit too
  dependent on luck of the tile draw, but I enjoy it nonetheless.  I managed to jump
  on two map tiles Ken laid out by using several amphoras as once, consuming the best
  resource spots and effectively blocking him out of his freshly placed terrain. 
  This gave me plenty of room to breath and allowed me to finish about 3–4 buildings
  ahead of him. While waiting for dinner, the boys and I played a three-player favorite
  of mine, Wyatt Earp.  Both boys managed to catch me off-guard in consecutive games,
  going out about 2 turns before I expected and snatching way too many points.  Final
  score was Matthew: $15, Jacob: $14, and Chris: $13.  We played two hands.'
