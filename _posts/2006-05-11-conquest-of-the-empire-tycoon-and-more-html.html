excerpt: 'Oh, so much more.  I detest meta-blogging, but let me start by apologizing
  for the lack of content around here for a while.  You’ve missed out on all the gaming
  that happened when the Ginns visited (though Jim blogged it), several playings of
  Twilight Struggle (awesome game that I hope to play again Saturday), and the rest
  of my trip to Israel.  Time to play catch-up. Side note: gaming actually started
  Thursday evening as the boys and I wrapped up our long-postponed game of Attack!
  the Expansion.  I pulled out a narrow victory over Matthew, who made a surprising
  comeback and shocked both Jacob and me with his final point total.  We played a
  slightly shortened game to 10 “eagle” cards. While most of the the rest of our gaming
  group journeyed to Sunriver for Doug’s semi-annual gaming retreat, those of us Left
  Behind decided to gather at my house for as much gaming as we could squeeze in. 
  Ken and Brandon spent the weekend with us, with Ken taking a brief break on Saturday
  morning to run a Cub Scout meeting and the boys and I taking part in a Pitch/Hit/Run
  competition.  We opened up the weekend on Friday night with the roleplaying game
  Cat – it was a huge hit and everyone is anxious for another play.  It was the perfect
  end to a late night (we didn’t even start until about 10pm as the boys had baseball
  practice that evening) with everyone being a little punchy and tired. Saturday early
  afternoon we started our big game for the weekend – Conquest of the Empire II. 
  This was a much-appreciated gift from the Ginns that fell onto my wishlist after
  I traded away Struggle of Empires.  I was certain this game would have the right
  mix of depth, theme, and components to delight my family and friends and I wasn’t
  disappointed.  We played game II – the more strategic Martin Wallace / Glen Drover
  game that features alliances, cards, and 2–action rounds that kept downtime to a
  minimum.  We found ourselves using a narrow strip of the map (surrounding the Med)
  which I suspect isn’t unusual for this game, and the game was tight and fun through
  the end.  We called it after three ages so that we could continue playing other
  games after Peter and Eric arrived. I was surprised at how approachable the game
  was for Matthew.  The money management was difficult, but I think he learned his
  lessons and would be much stronger in a second play.  We had a healthy dose of diplomacy
  and influence going on in the game… much healthier than the conflict I often see
  when we play games of this sort. While I cooked up some dinner for everyone Peter,
  Eric, and Ken played Peter’s construction of Schact’s InterUrban.  Don’t know much
  about the game – looked like a deeper Carcassonne-style game.  KC arrived at the
  tail end of dinner and we brought out Peter’s copy of Vegas Showdown.  The buzz
  is escalating on this game as it shows some staying power with gamers despite the
  Hasbro / WOTC heritage, and I can see why.  The game is compared to Amun Re and
  Princes of Florence and I think it holds up favorably.  Peter dominated the game
  from the start, getting some early cashflow advantages that left us scrambling to
  keep up and losing out on bids.  This is probably going on my purchase list.  Even
  after the crowds left Saturday night, Ken and I persisted.  We decided to knock
  a few 2–player games off my burndown list.  First up was the George Parker classic
  Chivalry / Camelot.  While not a game I would play often, there is some real depth
  to this game and you can really get caught with your pants down if you don’t pay
  attention (ahem… thanks Ken).  The pieces move similarly to the kings in checkers,
  but there are some special knight pieces that can jump their own pieces before jumping
  (capturing) enemies.  You also have the option of moving a single piece to a single
  square, keeping the entire board reachable by any piece.  The end game can drag
  a bit and I ended up resigning before we let it go that far.  Worth a try if you
  can find it. Next up: Tally Ho.  I’m not sure where or when I got this game, but
  I know it has been on my shelf for about 2 years unplayed.  This is an asymetric
  tile flipping / moving game that was entertaining if a bit one-sided.  Maybe this
  is why we are supposed to switch sides and play again… or maybe I just stink at
  it.  This will be a fun one to play with younger kids.  On Sunday morning Mike joined
  Ken and me for his first play of Parthenon.  I raved about this game last year but
  my opinion has dropped a bit, mostly due to the lack of player interaction and luck
  factor.  For example, in this game I found a wool shortage harbor card on my first
  turn (I happened to be the big wool producer) and this launched me into a significant
  lead early in the game, allowing me to finish my 2 wonders about mid way through
  the second year.  Now of course Ken and Mike made me pay for this fortune by keeping
  me out of the Archon role and punishing me heavily with events in the second year,
  but a string of bad cruises across the Med by Mike kept them from catching me. 
  I know I came away with a not-so-satisfying victory and Mike wasn’t impressed with
  the game.  Ken still maintains that it is his kind of game and I certainly will
  continue to play it with the kids, but I’m less enthused about it. While we played
  Parthenon, Graham joined the boys for a 2v2 game of Duel of Ages with a few expansions. 
  Apparently Jacob and Brandon came out on top.  Our last game of the weekend was
  Tycoon, a game I had been trying to play again since my initial play in Arizona nearly
  three years ago.  We had a bit of rules confusion early on but quickly got started. 
  Mike and I made crucial money management mistakes in the first season, forcing us
  to return home for a loan just as the season was running out.  I think this is a
  bad thing to happen, and it certainly kept us behind the curve.  Mike responded
  very well, taking apart Ken action by action and ending up the victor by a narrow
  margin.  Fun, relatively quick game (for the depth) if a bit dry.  I also think
  the game is better with four people as you get a little more action and competition
  for spaces in the cities. Missing Sunriver was a bad thing, but such a full weekend
  of gaming made up for the loss.  Thanks to everyone that joined us.'
