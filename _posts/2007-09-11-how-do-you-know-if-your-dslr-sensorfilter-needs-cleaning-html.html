excerpt: " On some landscape shots I've taken recently I've noticed some significant
  spotting on the resulting images.  I've cleaned my lenses and the spotting remains,
  so it is most likely an issue on the camera sensor (actually the filter in front
  of the sensor).  I followed Bob Atkins' advice and took some shots that would neutralize
  any lens effects and repeated with a separate lens.  The results are clear - I need
  to do some cleaning.        "

<p>On some landscape shots I've taken recently I've noticed some significant spotting on the resulting images. I've cleaned my lenses and the spotting remains, so it is most likely an issue on the camera sensor (actually the filter in front of the sensor). I followed <a href="http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/sensor_cleaning_ii.html">Bob Atkins' advice</a> and took some shots that would neutralize any lens effects and repeated with a separate lens. The results are clear - I need to do some cleaning. </p>
