excerpt: 'I''ve managed to attend a few different gaming sessions over the past 10
  days.  Two Saturdays ago Jacob and I traveled to Vancouver to attend a game day
  at Doug & Mimi''s - our first time there in quite a long while.  As always their
  hospitality was first rate - swedish meatballs, good wine (OK, I brought the wine),
  and great company. I jumped on the opportunity to play Anno 1503, a title I''ve
  wanted to play for a while.  Opinions are certainly split on this game (it has a
  relatively low BGG rating of 6.63 right now), and while it was enjoyable I doubt
  this is a game I would ask to play very often.         Tyler, Doug, Jacob and I
  play Anno 1503.  The board in the middle represents only a small portion of the
  game (island exploration) - most of the action occurs in each players'' individual
  area. Some have classified this game as multiplayer solitaire, but I think that''s
  a bit harsh.  There was plenty of player interaction (dialog, tradeoff discussions)
  - much more than in the St. Petersburg game that followed. I just didn''t see much
  that was new or interesting in the game.  I would much rather play a new Settlers
  scenario if I want a resource acquisition / building game (and Settlers has trading
  - Anno does not), or Entdecker if I want to play an exploration game.         Another
  group decided to play the new crayon rail game Russian Rails. I jokingly commented
  ''see you in 6 hours,'' which turned out to be not far from the truth as they were
  still playing when Jacob and I left 5 hours later. Jacob and I finished the evening
  with a game of St. Petersburg with two folks we''d never met before (and I forgot
  to write down their names! one of you reads this weblog, so please write your name
  in a comment to me).  This was a four-player game with three fairly seasoned players
  plus Jacob - he is still learning the ropes to this game and it can be a rough ride
  when you are playing with players with experience.         St. Petersburg was our
  final game of the evening. That was it for Saturday.  The following Thursday evening
  I was in the Tigard/Beaverton area for a district scouting meeting, so I stopped
  by Mike''s place for my gaming group''s Die Hard Thursday event.  Tim was also there
  and my arrival was timed well.  I suggested Hansa, the game of trading and merchants of
  the Hansiatic League.  A fairly dry (surprise) game, but I found it to be quite
  unique and fun.  It played quickly and I would like to see this played more in our
  group.          Tim, Mike, and I playing Hansa. There''s a real arc to this game
  and Tim played well, transitioning to populating as many merchants in cities as
  he could towards the end of the game.  Mike and I caught on a bit late but were
  able to close the gap and tighten up the game.  I finished second to Tim a couple
  of points behind, I think Mike was one point behind me. Next up was what is quickly
  becoming my favorite trick-taking card game, Die Sieben Siegel.  I played my best
  game so far, winning by a relatively large margin.  I''m not sure this is a great
  three-player game, but we did have fun.  I think it is probably quite a bit more
  chaotic this way as it can be difficult to assess hand strength when one player
  chooses to be the traitor.         We finished the evening playing the Steven Segal
  game. The next Friday was our weekly gaming session at work.  Eric Landes and I
  decided to start this a while back and we are starting to promote it a bit more. 
  We have new tenants sub-leasing space at our corporate HQ and, as they share the
  cafe with us, we thought it made sense to publicize what we are doing and make folks
  feel welcome joining us.  We''ll see if attendance picks up beyond the 4-5 regulars
  we have now.  Eric did a nice promotional flyer for us:       Last Friday we brought
  out the Knizia classic Samurai, one of the first games I picked up after re-entering
  the gaming world two years ago.  This game is extremely easy to teach and learn
  but has some great depth.  Arron enjoyed the game enough that he went out and bought
  his own copy at Rainy Day Games.  I was the winner in a close final showdown with
  Jason.'
