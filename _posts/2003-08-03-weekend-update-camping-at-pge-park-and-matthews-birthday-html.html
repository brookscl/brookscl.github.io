excerpt: We had a blast this weekend.  Friday night Jacob had his first official football
  practice Friday evening after a week of football camp in the evenings put on by
  Sherwood high school.  This will be Jacob's first year playing football and he's
  very excited.  Saturday morning we picked up his gear then I took Matthew and Jacob
  out for 9 holes of golf.  We like to have little contests while we play - usually
  a team net score we're shooting for and a little bingo-bango-bongo competition. 
  We missed our team goal of 160 strokes by just 1 stroke - I was happy with my play
  - I took a stab at playing with just a 5-iron, 52-deg wedge, and putter and shot
  a 34 (par is 30 on this executive course).       Saturday evening we loaded up the
  car and drove downtown for the Portland Beavers game for Scout Night - not just
  any special night, but a night where we get to camp out on the field.  This was
  even more fun than I thought it would be.  A perfect evening - the four of us were
  called down to the field for a promotional tug-o-war and we won some bats and balls. 
  The game was a thriller - 4 runs in the bottom of 9th inning for the Beavers to
  win the game, including a 3-run smash out of the park in left field.     After the
  game we picked up our gear and set up camp on the field.  InFocus sponsored a movie
  showing on the field (The Rookie - great flick written by local talent Mike Rich). 
  The weather was so nice that we eschewed our tent and slept under the stars (the
  nice artificial turf in center field didn't hurt either).  That's Julie and Matthew
  you see engrossed in the movie.  Definitely a late night - the movie didn't end
  until 1:30am - and we had to head out early from the park since they had a day game
  today.     Sunday at least started a little bit more quietly - I joined the boys
  for a 2-lap race of Formula De and we prepared for Matthew's low-key birthday party
  this afternoon.  We had some friends over, did some tie-dye t-shirts, and played
  croquet and bocce balls.  Matthew is now 7, but given his penchant for dictating
  his personal fashion choices he feels like 17 at times.
