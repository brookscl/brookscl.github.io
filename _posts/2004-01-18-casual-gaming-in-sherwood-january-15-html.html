excerpt: Our new friend Kevin McKenzie was still in town on business (we gamed with
  him last week), so we invited a few folks over for some gaming at our home on Wednesday
  night.  Attendees were Ken and Brandon Rude, Mike Deans, Kevin Graham, KC Humphrey,
  and Kevin McKenzie. Domaine KevinM, Julie, and I played this last week, and Kevin
  was eager to give it another try.  I was of a similar mind, but Bus sounded even
  more interesting to me so I passed and Mike Deans joined in.        Mike Deans,
  Julie, and Kevin McKenzie prepare their castles and knights in Domaine. I don't
  have a lot of detail on how the game went, but it sounded like a struggle between
  Kevin and Julie.  Julie discounted her chances as the game drew to a close, but
  apparently a mine monopoly belonging to Julie that they had forgotten to score turned
  out to be the clincher - Julie won the game.         Not sure what Julie's so happy
  about, but this is near the end-game. You may have noticed the poker chips in the
  photos.  When we were in Vegas recently for Christmas, I was hell-bent on picking
  up some high quality poker chips.  After some research and advice, we discovered
  the Gamblers General Store and found a great set of chips (these aren't cheap!). 
  Besides using them for card games (mostly Texas Hold'em), we also use them as replacement
  money for games that have cheap currency (paper or cardboard money usually). Bus
  This was on my must-play list, mostly because it is so highly regarded by Mikael
  Sheikh, with whom I gamed in New York City last summer.  He even implemented an
  online version of the game that I am now ready to try.  KC has had this game on
  loan for quite a while and he offered to teach Ken, KevinG, and I how to play.         KC
  teaches Ken, Kevin Graham, and I how to play Bus. This is similar to some of the
  other transportation-oriented games I've played, and it reminds me the most of Paris
  Paris (though Bus is a bit deeper with more choices).  It has some very interesting
  mechanics.  The basic idea of the game is to provide bus transportation for folks
  in the city by building routes that connect to buildings (homes, offices, and pubs). 
  Depending on the time of day, all of the people on the board will desire to go to
  one building type (morning - work, evening - pub, night - home).  There is a great
  description of the mechanics of the game over at Funagain (read Ben Baldanza's review
  from Counter), so I won't go into much more detail here.  I like games with an economy
  of difficult choices and the opportunity to look ahead a bit and strategize.  Bus
  certainly has this, and I liked it very much.  I found myself trying to predict
  what moves the other players would make and trying to optimize my moves.        Final
  board and scoring for Bus. I got off to a decent start and was in the lead or close
  to it the entire game.  I made some bad building choices towards the end, and on
  my last move I really needed to move 3 people to their homes to guarantee at least
  a tie.  Unfortunately I could only move 2 of them, and my efforts to disrupt Ken's
  last move didn't pan out because he had a solid backup plan. I'd like to pick up
  this game, but I'm very frustrated with the production quality (I'm having similar
  reservations about the game boards in Columbia Games' block games).  The boards
  were very warped, hardly stayed together, and were difficult to read.  Have the
  newer printings of the game improved on this at all?  Leave me a comment if you
  have opinions either way. Pizza! KC (man this guy is prolific!) introduced another
  one of his game prototypes - presumably he dreamed this game over just in the past
  week.  I didn't play it, but it looked fun and on the surface seemed to have some
  similarities to Mamma Mia!.         KC teaches his new prototype Pizza. From the
  comments I heard during and after the game, this sounds like a good one and will
  be worth a try in the future.        Brandon and Mike contemplate their ingredient
  choices. Scream Machine I read some favorable reviews of Scream Machine in the recent
  issue of Counter so I requested that this come out.  KevinG owns the game and offered
  to teach Julie, KevinM, and I.  The theme is building a theme park that will attract
  the most visitors - that's how the scoring track goes.  This is a card game that
  has some interesting mechanics, but unfortunately the card design makes it very
  difficult to keep track of ride types and scoring.  The designers could have spent
  some more time thinking about the human factors.  A fun little game though, but
  probably not one I'll be interested in purchasing.  I actually prefer Roller Coaster
  Tycoon to this game, and I know the kids would as well.         Kevin teaches Julie,
  KevinM, and I Scream Machine.
