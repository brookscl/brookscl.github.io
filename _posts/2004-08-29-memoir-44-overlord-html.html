excerpt: Jacob and I went over to Ken & Brandon's house this weekend to try out a
  two-board game of Memoir '44 Overlord.  Days of Wonder was kind enough to give me
  another copy of the game for my work at GenCon, and I gave this to the Rudes knowing
  how much they've enjoyed the game (and likely will enjoy it in the future). Overlord
  is a style of play whereby one player on each team plays the role of commander-in-chief,
  governing the distribution of command cards to one or more field generals who are
  responsible for certain sections of the board.  Ideally this version is played with
  3 or 4 players on a side to allow for separate individual control of the left, center,
  and right sections.  We decided to wing it a bit with 2 vs. 2, with decent results.         Ken
  setting up the Omaha Beach - Overlord scenario. There is only one officially published
  overlord scenario - Omaha Beach - so that's what we played.  Setup takes a while,
  around 15 minutes, but cleanup is even longer considering the co-mingling of the
  parts.         Final setup before starting the Omaha beach scenario. We adopted
  the overlord rules a bit for 2-player.  We had one player take the role of commander-in-chief,
  deciding how to dole out the command cards.  Jacob and Brandon wanted to team up,
  so in the first game they played the allies invading, while Ken and I played the
  Germans defending.  Jacob and I were the respective commanders-in-chief.  Brandon
  was in charge of the right flank and half of the center, Ken in charge of the left
  flank and half of the center (i.e., Ken and Brandon were facing off). Each team
  starts with 8 command cards, and with certain restrictions up to three can be played
  in a given turn.  The CIC decides what card(s) to give to his field general, and
  that field general is required to take what he is given.  We were a bit lenient
  with Brandon and Jacob and allowed them to discuss cards, strategy, etc.  Ken and
  I assumed there was very little direct conversation so our communication was mostly
  in the form of card distribution.  This is a fairly tactical, reactive game in most
  cases so there isn't much room for discussion of grand strategy. One flaw we believe
  there is in the overlord rules is the ability to use Recon command cards as if they
  were barrages.  In both of our games (we played then switched sides), recon/barrage
  was used over 5 times to eliminate the allied armor and weakened infantry units.         Jacob
  and Brandon celebrate their axis victory in game 2, winning 8-1. In both games,
  the axis player was able to successfully defend Normandy.  The first game, where
  Ken and I played the axis, was very close, ending in an 8-5 score.  We were ahead
  7-2 for a while, but the allies came storming back and made it a close game.  The
  second game wasn't even close, partly due to poor die rolls and partly due to the
  use of recon/barrage by the axis on the first 5 turns of the game. In future games
  we'll likely take out that rule, or only allow it to be used once in the game. Overall
  this was very satisfying - we completed 2 games and managed to complete setup and
  takedown in about 3 hours.  I think the overlord scenarios will play best with at
  least 3v3, with the CIC playing the center section.
