excerpt: " The biggest event each year for the boardgame hobby is Spiel, held in Essen,
  Germany each October.  There are quite a few Essen reports available online, but
  if you read only one be sure to check out Mark Johnson's report in The Games Journal.
  \  One interesting part of Mark's commentary was his take on the crowd makeup at
  Essen.  To quote:     It's an impressive sight. Essen was generally so packed with
  people that getting through the aisles was difficult. And this was only Friday!
  The next day's attendance would be even greater. The crowd, while thick, was a lot
  more pleasant than those that I've rubbed shoulders with at American conventions.
  You know what I mean? A very normal crowd. More twenty-something guys than anything
  else but not overwhelmingly so. There were lots of women, children and older folks
  too. Everyone was clean and generally sociable.   In a nutshell, there were far
  fewer of the weirdos and nerds so prevalent at the American cons I've attended.
  If boardgaming is ever to gain as much of a presence in our society, it will need
  to see a similar shift in audience. Wider participation in our hobby isn't likely
  as long as we've got so many games about orcs or gamers wearing costumes. Actually,
  there was one hall (of about six) that featured various dragon-y things, swords
  and armor merchants. Craig Berg called it the American convention inside Essen!
  \    Having attended a few American game conventions (GenCon and the local Game
  Storm), I can see where Mark is coming from.  The people-watching is a unlike most
  other gatherings (think trekkie convention), but there can be negatives. There were
  signs all over the Indianapolis convention center that read something like this:
  \  Avoid Gamer Funk - All of the Local Hotels Provide Shampoo and Soap Use Them!
  \  I don't think this is a serious concern in the areas we attended - the boardgaming
  set tends to not fit the gamer stereotype as much as the roleplaying gamers.   Apparently
  there's a big toy contingency as well as a hall dedicated to kids.  I must find
  a way to work a family trip to Germany around Speil next October! "
