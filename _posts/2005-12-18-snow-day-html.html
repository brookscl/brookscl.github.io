excerpt: Little did we know as we spent the first half of the day up on Mt Hood skiing
  that we would return to a winter storm that started with high winds and freezing
  rain and turned into a mild snowstorm.  I suspect about half an inch fell but it
  is pretty slick and nasty out there. Skiing was good but coooold.  The northeast
  winds were brutal up on top and conditions were icy but on the groomed slopes things
  weren’t too bad.  It was nice to get back up on the mountain but by 1pm we were
  done and drove back home.  Good thing we did as the storm was hitting greater Portland
  by then and traffic started to get a bit snarled. Surprisingly, despite complaining
  about the cold today both boys went outside to play in the snow.  No, that’s not
  Matthew with Jacob in the picture below – that’s our neighbor boy Michael.  Looks
  like the weather will not improve tonight, with a winter storm warning through the
  night with a promise of frozen rain.  Looks like the boys might be staying home
  from school tomorrow.
