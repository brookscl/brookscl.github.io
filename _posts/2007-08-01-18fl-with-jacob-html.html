excerpt: " I recently borrowed 18FL from Eric Landes to try another easier 2-player
  18xx game with Jacob.  We played a couple of weekends ago, again with good results,
  but it is clearly time to move onto some multiplayer 18xx.  Playing with two players
  (especially as nice as we play) does drag a bit towards the end-game - we felt as
  if we were on autopilot and stopped a turn short with the bank nearly out of money
  but not quite.    Jacob played the southern tier primarily, building the line to
  Cuba knowing it would get wiped out, then building it again in the final phase.
  \ When I say we played nice, I mean real nice - nobody tokened out Ft. Lauderdale
  or Miami, allowing the northern lines to run freely to Cuba.    Final scores: Chris
  $9,747, Jacob $7,995.  Time to reach out to Eric to schedule a 3 or 4 player game,
  perhaps we try out 1850 again and play along the Mississippi. "
