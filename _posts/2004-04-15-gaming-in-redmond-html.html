excerpt: 'Finally some gaming! I was in Seattle/Redmond today on business, so I drove
  up last night for some late-night gaming with the Microsoft (and Boards & Bits)
  folks.  This was the first time I sat down for some face-to-face gaming since before
  my Asia trip.  Thanks to Tom Powers and crew for inviting me, and thanks to Microsoft
  for providing the space. Manga Manga Two word review on this game: crap crap.  I
  like manga art as much as the next guy, but believe me this game is in no way related
  to the theme.  Quick summary of rule mechanics: real-time game, slap down the right
  card so that the color in the little circle in the upper left-hand part of the card
  matches the color of the shield on the card at the top of the discard pile.  Think
  speed or slap-jack.  The first player to get rid of his hand wins a prize token;
  whoever has the most cards in his hand gets a consolation token.        Tom contemplates
  his strategy for the upcoming hand of Manga Manga.  Hmmm, strategy? There are serious
  human factors issues with this game.  I''m starting to notice this more and more
  with games I play, mostly related to color choices and the inclusion of distracting
  elements that make it difficult to quickly determine type information about game
  pieces.  Every game designer should study Edward Tufte.  In the case of Manga Manga
  there are a few major design flaws:  The Manga artwork on the cards only distracts
  from the game play by making it difficult to determine the colors (top-left and
  shield). Some of the colors (namely blue and purple) are too close and hard to distinguish. 
  Or maybe it is just my adult onset color blindness. (I could get used to this) When
  looking at the top of the discard pile, it can be difficult to focus on the shield
  as the target color and not the circle. Even without these issues, I wouldn''t enjoy
  this game.  Too light, too reflexive for my tastes. Ticket to Ride There has been
  quite a bit of hype about this game, so I was eager to try it out.  I opened my
  own copy (we made a bulk order of about $500 worth of games with Boards & Bits and
  this was one of my purchases) and we started laying our track. It is easy to make
  initial comparisons with Transamerica, and there are certainly some similarities. 
  The primary way you score points is by building track segments between cities to
  connect more distant cities.  Since its an Alan Moon game, you might also think
  there would be similarities to Union Pacific.  Other than the train theme, there
  really aren''t any similarities to that game, other than the mechanic used to draw
  cards.        Endgame track layout.  I thought I did well, completing 5 tickets
  with no missed ones.  Finished last though. I think this might be a really good
  game.  The components are nice, though it would be cool if the trains weren''t plastic. 
  Then again, they are cool detailed little locomotives so I can live with them. The
  game includes a number of different mechanics - hidden goals, set collection, and
  connectivity and route management.  They play together well, and there was a ton
  of tension while playing the game, mostly relating to the tough choice of drawing
  more cards or laying down track now before somebody blocks you. I hope to play again
  this weekend and I''ll give another report.  Tom thrashed us all, scoring in the
  130s. Ali Baba I ran to get some dinner so the rest of the crew played Ali Baba,
  an interesting memory game that looks like it might be fun for kids.        Memory
  game - players try and unlock the chest by making the symbols match the solution
  card. Schrille Stille For our last game of the night, I opened my new copy of Schrille
  Stille to teach the crowd.  This is basically a party game, but I love it for the
  fun and the coolest mechanical gadget I''ve seen in a game since Mouse Trap.        Preparing
  to place our votes in Schrille Stille. Each player owns a record label and works
  to influence the popularity of artists on their (and others'') labels.  This is
  done using a secret voting and tabulation mechanism that looks like a turntable. 
  This is not a strategic game - it is pretty random but players that are good at
  tracking group-think can do well in this game.  I highly recommend this game for
  gamers and non-gamers as a light party game.        The board is where you track
  the artists, and the round thing is the vote tabulator.'
