excerpt: " Jacob and I were finally able to attend another group gaming session on
  Saturday, this one held at Doug and Mimi's up in Vancouver.  We had a great time,
  and as usual they were excellent hosts.  This session lasted from about 1pm to 9:30pm. 
  On with the games...  Formula Motor Racing   Jacob and I didn't play this one, but
  Doug, Mimi, Phil (a friend of Doug/Mimi up from San Francisco), Sabrina, and Greg. 
  Doug ended up the victor in this one, which finished up shortly after we arrived.
  \    A Dog's Life   Doug, Sabrina, Greg, and I started a game of Amun Re, while
  Jacob, Mimi, and Phil decided to give A Dog's Life a try.  This was a new one for
  me - I hadn't seen or heard of it before.       Jacob loved the theme, and overhearing
  some of the conversation about piddling and “you can't pick up food until you drop
  your bone“ sounded pretty humurous.  Really cute dog figurines too.  Phil was the
  winner.     Maestro   Mimi always does such a great job picking out games for Jacob
  to play - she tries hard to find light, funny themes in their vast game collection. 
  Next on the table for Mimi, Phil, and Jacob was Maestro.  Apparently players are
  trying to hire musicians to debut in a concert.  Phil managed to win again.     Amun
  Re   It has been a while since I'd played this game, and Sabrina/Greg were intrigued
  by the theme.  Doug, Sabrina, Greg and I squared off for a game of this pyramid-building
  Egyption game.  Doug and I went head to head, and I had the upper hand after the
  old age (first round of scoring) with a slim lead of two points.      Things got
  very contested in the second age.  I made a critical mistake in the bidding for
  one province.  I had the power card that prevents someone from overbidding by one,
  and played it after bidding 3 gold.  I should have bid 6 and forced Doug to go up
  to 15, but he grabbed it for 10.  And 15 was beyond my means, so I had to leave
  it for him.  This was probably a deciding factor in the game - it gave him 2+ pyramids
  and some good production.  I managed to keep it close and went for the most gold
  and the 6 victory points that go with that, hoping that my give me the edge.  This
  meant making a substantial sacrifice in the last round to drive up the farmer harvest. 
  Trouble was, Doug also owned the province with the two temples, so this ended up
  helping him more than it did me.  Doug ended up with 50 points, I had 46.  Greg
  and Sabrina had cash flow issues - it took too long for them to understand the production
  cycles and some of the tradeoffs (like making sure you get some farmers early).
  \ Autoscooter   Did I mention that Doug and Mimi have a butler?      Seriously,
  Greg had to take off for a hospital charity event.  Fortunately, right at this time
  (about 4pm) 3 new guests arrived.  Joining us were Tyler, a local Vancouver resident
  who is finishing up his MA in Medieval history, Kim, who recently moved to the Portland
  area from Tucson (we've gamed with her before), and Michelle, who just moved up
  here from Monteray.  We thought it would be a good idea to try a light game that
  everyone could play together, so out came Autoscooter.      This is a light “programming“
  game, ala Robo Ralley or Dragon Delta.  Each player controls a bumper car, and the
  goal is to crash into the other players' cars without letting them hit you.  Cars
  can drive at speeds from 0-3 (indicating the number of hexes move), and can accelerate
  +1/-1 per turn.  Each player starts with 10 chips that represent points, and when
  you crash into an opponent in the right way you can steal their chips.  It obviously
  doesn't make much sense to crash into someone that has run out of chips.   Players
  plot their moves each turn, using a letter-coded quick reference guide that describes
  several pre-plotted moves.  For example, if you are going at a speed of two, then
  you could plot a move where you advance forward one hex, turn 60 deg to the left,
  then go forward a hex, then turn 60 deg to the right.  I was extremely luck in this
  game (it can be quite chaotic with this many players) - I was never bumped during
  the entire game and ended up with 28 chips.  Phil also did well and finished with
  23.  You can see the (slightly blurry - sorry) scoresheet below.     Puerto Rico
  \  Phil, Tyler, Michelle, and Kim embarked on a game of Puerto Rico.  It was hard
  for me to resist - this game is one of my favorites.  But I wanted to try Warcraft,
  so I'll have to wait for another opportunity.  Tyler won this game - I don't know
  what the scores were.     Warcraft: the Boardgame   I received Warcraft Saturday
  morning in a Funagain order (along with Lord of the Rings Risk: Trilogy Edition
  and New England).  Doug, Jacob, and I agreed to play and learn as we go.  The rules
  recommend playing a special scenario called The Elf Gate when playing with three
  players, so that's what we did.      The rules were a snap to learn - the most time
  was spent sorting pieces; there are tons of bits in this game!  Overall quality
  is nice.  There are some complaints about the lack of miniatures for this game -
  each of the races uses generic wooden pieces for melee, ranged, and flying combat
  units.  It didn't bother us at all, and the strong color differentiation was nice.
  \  Things start off slow in this game, with very little player interaction.  This
  is much like the computer game, as players focus on harvesting resources, upgrading
  units, building new production facilities, and training units.  Each race has some
  specialization - I played humans, Jacob was undead, and Doug played the orcs.  In
  this scenario, there is also a cluster of neutral night elves in the middle of the
  board.  Players are trying to get control of the elf gate in the middle of the board
  - control consists of having a unit in the middle of the board, with less than 3
  enemy or neutral units adjacent to the middle.   I decided to only train ranged
  and melee units, avoiding the costly flying units to see if I could conserve resources. 
  I started pushing to the left and center, trying to make my way into the middle. 
  In three player games like this, he who attacks first is often the loser, so everyone
  was very patient.   Things got interesting when Doug decided to come in on my right
  flank towards my town center - I had just a few units there and looked fairly exposed. 
  He fell right into my trap, since I had two town portal cards that allowed me to
  teleport six of my combat units into supporting positions (see the picture below). 
  This created a huge setback for Doug as I wiped out a significant chunk of his military.
  \     Then I made a serious tactical error.  Jacob in the meanwhile was working
  his way into the middle - we had a bit of a skirmish on our borders, and he decided
  to lay off and start fighting the elves.  He had also trained a flying unit that
  was in range of the center - now vacant since I had cleaned it out.   Doug was still
  a threat, so I extended myself out on the right flank to hopefully finish him off
  and then take the middle.  So I engaged him on one of the squares adjacent to the
  middle.  It was a tight battle that I won, but each of us lost all of our units
  on the contested hex.  This left only two of my units adjacent to the middle square. 
  Next it was Jacob's turn.   Jacob wisely flew his unit two hexes into the center,
  then engaged the only remaining elf units in his way.  It was a close battle, and
  only one of his units survived.  But it was enough for Jacob to claim victory, since
  I had only two units adjacent to the middle.  You can see the final results below
  - Jacob was purple, I was blue, and Doug was red.     Take it Easy   While I cleaned
  up Warcraft, Jacob joined everyone else for one final game of the evening (for us
  anyway).  Take it Easy is a fantastic puzzle game.  I don't remember who the winners
  were, but two tied for the win with 158 points.  "
