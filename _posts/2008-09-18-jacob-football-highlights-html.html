excerpt: 'I have a couple of highlight reels to post for Jacob''s football so far
  this weekend. The first one below is a collection of defensive highlights for Jacob,
  including his first ever ball carry (he''s been over the weight limit every prior
  season so always had to take a knee when recovering the ball). The second one is
  a game summary from his team''s season opener vs. Beaverton put together by another
  parent. Both boys are having great seasons. Jacob''s team is 2-0 with a home game
  vs. Hillsboro on Saturday night. Matthew''s team is 1-1, having opened his season
  against a tough Lincoln team that we hope to have a chance to face again in the
  playoffs. He is playing down in Scappoose on Saturday at noon.                   '
