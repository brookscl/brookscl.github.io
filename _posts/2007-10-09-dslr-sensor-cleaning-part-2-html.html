excerpt: " I wasn't at all satisfied with the results of my prior sensor cleaning
  and was noticing some significant spotting, particularly with some flash shots on
  my 28-135mm lens.  I did some quick tests tonight to confirm the sensor/filter issue
  and the results confirmed by suspicions.   This was taken with my 30mm:    This
  with my 28-135mm:    There was a great article in a recent Shutterbug magazine about
  this very problem and the Dust-Aid product was recommended.  It comes in a convenient,
  easy to carry Band-Aid type metal box and the instructions couldn't have been easier
  to follow.  They even have a disclaimer about Canon filters and say they'll replace
  it if their product does any damage so I felt confident going into the process.
  \ The results were spectacular - I could find no evidence of any dust on the sensor/filter
  after applying Dust-Aid.  The product isn't cheap but I suspect I'll only need to
  use it every 2 months, so it should last a couple of years.  Well worth it so consider
  it if you are having similar problems.  After cleaning:  "
