excerpt: I like posting about music I’m listening to because I usually get good pointers
  to other artists that I’ll enjoy.  So keep the recommendations coming! An automatic
  purchase for me recently was Son Volt’s Okemah and the Melody of Riot.  I’ve long
  been a fan of Uncle Tupelo (going back to my late college years in St. Louis where
  they were a local band) and while I’ve generally agreed with critics that Wilco
  was the better of the two bands formed from the Uncle Tupelo bifurcation (Son Volt
  being the other), I find myself listening to Jay Farrar and Son Volt a lot more
  than I do Jeff Tweedy and Wilco.  Julie and I caught Son Volt’s live show here in
  Portland earlier this year and I think she has turned into a genuine fan as well;
  at least I catch her listening to the CD at home from time to time.  So if you are
  a fan of Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and other singer-songwriters with some country influence,
  check this one out. Julie had me pick up a few CDs from Amazon recently, namely
  Coldplay’s X&Y, Green Day’s American Idiot, and Weezer’s Make Believe.  I also added
  Beck’s Guero to the order.  So, I expected to like American Idiot and Guero quite
  a bit, was skeptical about Make Believe, and had no clue what to expect with X&Y. 
  I rarely listen to music on the radio and Coldplay has never even been on my radar. 
  I think I remember hearing comparisons to U2 and the Beatles and that they are perhaps
  the best band so far of the 21st century, which drastically reduced my interest
  in seeking them out.  I had visions of the Oasis hype back in the mid 90s.  Boy,
  was I surprised – this album is as good as anything I’ve heard from U2 (and I’m
  a huge Joshua Tree fan) and now I understand the hype.  They are also very different
  than just about everything I’ve been listening to for the past few years, which
  is a pleasant change.  Some times talent does lead to extreme popular success. My
  final mention is of Fall Out Boy.  BMG Music recently acquired the music club part
  of Columbia House, and I had a lingering membership that was transfered over.  Somewhere
  in the shuffle they think I failed to decline one of the monthly selections (I’m
  certain I did) and I was going to return it, but instead opened it to give it a
  listen and rip into iTunes.  I’m glad I did – From Under the Cork Tree is a fine
  album that I’m enjoying.  This is mild punk rock with some good pop harmonies –
  reminds me of Green Day and The Clash.
