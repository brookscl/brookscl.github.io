<p>I first started doing “<a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2004/01/03/my-5-10-report-for-2003-html/">five and dime</a>” reports 13 years ago. This is a summary of games I played at least 5 or 10 times in the prior year. For many years <a href="http://akapastorguy.blogspot.com/2012/05/five-dime-2011-so-long-thanks-for-all.html">Mark Jackson was the keeper of the aggregated Five and Dime list</a>, and it is a fun distraction to go travel through that wormhole and see what the hotness was five to ten years ago.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1929" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/01/Churchill.jpg" alt="Churchill.jpg" width="700" height="524" /></p>
<p>I played 212 times in 2015 with a noticeable break while <a href="http://plan-pack-go.com/6-weeks-in-ireland/">Julie and I traveled in Ireland</a>. I was surprised about a few games that didn't show up on the list, but those had four plays: <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur">Jaipur</a>, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132018/churchill">Churchill</a>, and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128621/viticulture">Viticulture</a>.</p>
<p>Still, things are picking up and I'm playing more games. Julie and I are much more likely to pull out a quickie game at night now (hence our new fascination with Five Crowns, which actually doesn't suck).</p>
<p>Here is the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1472/five-crowns">Five Crowns</a> – mainstream rummy like</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> – Isn't it amazing that 13 years ago I was mentioning that I still pull out decks made 8 years ago? Still playing with those decks today that are almost as old as my 21 year old son.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/243/advanced-squad-leader">Advanced Squad Leader</a> – My new obsession with <a href="http://dugsreports.blogspot.com/">gaming partner Doug</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164874/airborne-commander">Airborne Commander</a> – I think I got in all five plays over a three day period. The game is tough, but fun, and I'll be playing again soon.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames">Codenames</a> – Favorite party game from 2015 and it was a hit over the holidays.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136063/forbidden-desert">Forbidden Desert</a> – We still haven't figured out how to win this game yet, which is a good sign for a cooperative game (if you like dying of thirst in a sandstorm, that is). I want to keep trying to crack this one though some in my family are less enthused.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi">Hanabi</a> – This was “new to me” in 2015 and is one of the more creative games I've played lately. This is a four player puzzle game (I guess you can play with two or three but I like four) where the group needs to come up with communication conventions to share hidden information. I suspect it becomes solvable for groups that play a lot, but I enjoy introducing this to new people.</li>
</ul>
