excerpt: "  GameStorm 9, March 30 - April 1 at the Portland Airport Sheraton, will
  be featuring Reiner Knizia as its guest of honor this year.  There are several reasons
  why I'm excited to attend this year:  Dr. Knizia will be there I will be running
  the Kniziathon This location should be substantially better than the Red Lion last
  year.  Our hotel room situation was a disaster last year, and I've already managed
  to book a nice room with 2 queen beds. The timing is nice, coming right on the end
  of spring break for the kids.  This will make it easy for Jacob and I to get there
  early on Friday and miss the often terrible cross-town traffic."
