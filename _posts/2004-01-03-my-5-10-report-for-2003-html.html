excerpt: 'Many folks who play board games will provide a year-end report of games
  they played, often in a form known as a “5 & 10” or “five and dime” report.  This
  is because the report will list all games played 10 or more times and those played
  5-9 times - this is obviously an indicator of what people are playing frequently. 
  It does tend to skew results towards lighter fare since longer games don''t come
  out as often. I didn''t keep terribly accurate data on my gaming this year.  I was
  pretty good at keeping things up to date in my GameTracker software, but fell off
  in the July timeframe.  Fortunately this weblog provides a decent log of what I
  played with groups outside the home; unfortunately many of the games that get brought
  out casually at my home are missing.  Therefore I will estimate some of the numbers.
  I will also include online games that I played with other human beings, some in
  real-time, some via email or play-by-web.  In case you are interested, this is what
  I played online last year:  Tigris and Euphrates (at the boardgamegeek)  Settlers
  of Catan (using Settlers 3D)  Carcassonne (at BSW, but only because I haven''t tried
  playing some other games like Puerto Rico there)  7th Sea (using Apprentice for
  7th Sea)  Magic (just a few games using Magic: the Gathering online)  Wallenstein
  (using Mikael Sheik''s great PBW version, still in beta) So here goes the list:
  Total Games Played: 309 Total Unique Games Played: 98 Games Played 10 or More Times  Settlers
  of Catan (16) - About half of these were played online.  Euphrat und Tigris (15)
  - All but two of these were played online.  Fluxx (15) - Many plays while sitting
  in a restaurant with the family.  7th Sea CCG (14) - I got back into this after
  getting some deals on eBay.  I also played in a couple of online, casual tournaments.  Apples
  to Apples (14) - Very popular with extended family and non-gamer friends.  Carcassonne
  (14) - Popular intro game, plus I played online 5 or 6 times.  Can''t Stop (12)
  - A favorite to bring out just before bed for Matthew and Jacob.  Magic: the Gathering
  (11) - Still one of my all-time favorite games.  I still just play with decks I
  built 8 years ago or pre-constructed decks for new expansions.  Liar''s Dice (10)
  - Another family favorite. Games Played 5-9 Times  Balloon Cup (8) - Matthew''s
  favorite 2-player game.  He beats me at least half the time.  Puerto Rico (7) -
  This would definitely be in the top 10 if I would learn to play it on BSW.  Any
  volunteers to mentor me?  Wyatt Earp (7) - My favorite rummy game.  Alpha Playing
  Cards (6) - Didn''t get played very much in the second half of the year.  Fresh
  Fish (6) - I wish my family enjoyed playing this more.  Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation
  (6) - This has been played 3 more times in the past 2 days in our household.  Great
  2-player game.  Piratenbucht (6) - Probably our favorite heavier family game.  Samurai
  (6)  Battlecards (6)  Chrononauts (5) - One of Jacob''s favorite games.  Very creative.  Dragon
  Delta (5)  King of the Elves (5)  Mystery Rummy 4 (5)  Wallenstein (5)  Zendo (5)
  Commentary I rediscovered board games about exactly one year ago.  The fun I''ve
  had this year is immeasurable - and I can''t stress enough how good this has been
  for our family.  I want to thank a number of people who welcomed me into their gaming
  groups and homes over the past year:  Kevin Graham  Doug and Mimi Walker  Ken Rude
  and family  Andy Christensen in Redmond  Angela Gaalema in Colorado Springs  The
  Card Benders in Dallas, TX  Mikael and Jonathan in Brooklyn, NY  The Arizona Boardgamers  Scott
  Alan Woodward in Burbank, CA  Greg Schloesser and the Westbank Gamers  The RipCityGamers
  Stay tuned for some of my awards and top “n” lists for 2003.'

<p>Many folks who play board games will provide a year-end report of games they<br />
