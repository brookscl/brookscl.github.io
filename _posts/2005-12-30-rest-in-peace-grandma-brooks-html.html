excerpt: My grandmother Brooks passed away earlier this week.  While she was my father’s
  step-mother (his mother passed away at age 11), she was always my grandma Brooks
  and she will be missed.  This is her obituary; services were held earlier this morning.  Meta
  Jane Brooks, 91, of Shelbyville, died Monday, Dec. 26, 2005, at Morristown Manor,
  in Morristown. Born Oct. 8, 1914, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, she was the daughter
  of the late George and Imogene (Virden) Masters. She married Louis Brooks Dec. 8,
  1951, and he preceded her in death Dec. 25, 1981. Survivors include four sons, Michael
  (wife, Lynne) Brooks of Shelbyville, Tom (wife, Linda) Brooks of Cedar Falls, Iowa,
  John (wife, Ann) Brooks of Green Valley, Ariz., and Dan (friend, Jeri) Brooks of
  LaSalle, Ill.; five grandchildren; two stepgrandchildren; nine great-grandchildren;
  and two stepgreat-grandchildren. Mrs. Brooks graduated from Iowa Wesleyan College,
  where she received a bachelor of science degree in home economics. She was later
  awarded an honorary doctorate degree from that school for her work in developing
  the science building on campus. She was a home economics teacher, retiring in 1985
  after 16 years in education. Mrs. Brooks also was employed as a county home Extension
  director in Iowa; as director of home economics for Borg Warner Corp.; as a home
  economics teacher in LaSalle, Ill., where she founded the food service vocational
  program; and as a school bus attendant in Melbourne, Fla. She was a member of the
  PEO and Alpha Xi Delta sorority. Mrs. Brooks moved to Shelbyville in 1999 and was
  a resident of McKay Manor until she moved to Morristown Manor two years ago. Friends
  and family may gather at 10:30 a.m. Friday at Carmony-Ewing Harrison Street Chapel,
  Freeman Family Funeral Homes, 819 S. Harrison St. A memorial service will be at
  11 a.m. Friday at the funeral home, with the Rev. Dr. Mary Lundgren and the Rev.
  Corlis Dees officiating. Interment will be in Forest Home Cemetery, in Mount Pleasant.
  Memorial contributions may be donated to Hospice of Shelby County, 110 South Harrison
  St., Shelbyville, IN 46176.
