excerpt: 'This will be a rather long session report - there was a ton of gaming going
  on last Saturday at Mike''s, mostly due to the unusually large crowd of 12 people. 
  Jacob joined me, but for the first time we didn''t actually plan any games together.
  Oasis First up was Oasis.  Mike was interested in another play (I first taught him
  at Game Storm a while back), and KC and George were eager to learn.  This is a very
  easy game to teach so we were on our way quickly.        George, KC, Mike, and I
  play Oasis. The key frustration I (and apparently others) have with this game is
  the potentially debilitating random card draw when making offers.  The next time
  we play this game we will try with open hands.  Perhaps this will lead to too much
  analysis, but it is certainly worth a try.  This would allow players to tailor their
  offers and better manage their hand size.  Of course it will certainly break the
  game in unforeseen ways.  In this game KC had a great showing, amassing a large
  quantity of steppes and the corresponding horse scoring tiles.  He finished around
  190, and I was the closest to him with around 120.        The final configuration
  in Oasis.  KC (red) managed a huge set of steppes and a decent collection of scoring
  tiles. Railroad Dice I was a bit disappointed to see this come out at a time when
  I couldn''t play it - this is one I''ve been wanting to try.  Feedback was mixed,
  but I think all players were interested in another try.  Patrick, Dave, and Chuck
  played; I believe Dave came out ahead. Comments from Dave: A fun system that''s
  right up my alley. Time will tell whether it''s a good system. My fears about the
  "game arc" were reflected in Doug Adams'' BGG comments, where he suggests that the
  game will usually end before folks start buying shares before companies change hands.
  In our game, the income was tilted heavily in the favor of Chuck and myself, and,
  with both of us receiving high income from two companies each, I was able to end
  the game by breaking the bank. Thumbs Up for now.         Attika Ken, Brandon, and
  Jacob showed up a bit late and decided to dive into a game of Attika.  This was
  the first game I''ve seen where a player one by completing all of their buildings,
  a task accomplished by Ken.         During the Oasis game KC was mounting some cards
  for one of his prototypes, so he enlisted some help from Peter, Erik, and Mike.        KC
  gets some card mounting help. Andromeda Peter brought out his copy of this classic
  game and taught it to Ken, Brandon, Jacob, and Erik (his son - not sure if he had
  played before).        Peter teaching Andromeda to the younger crowd. Northwest
  Trek While waiting for Railroad Dice to complete, KC and I taught George how to
  play one his newest prototypes.  The theme of this Cairo-tile laying game (I first
  talked about it here) is pretty cool - players manipulate photography teams trying
  to collect snapshots of wildlife in a conservation park.  This game is simple to
  learn but has enough depth to keep it interesting.  After 3 plays I''m anxious to
  get my own copy.        George contemplates his move in Northwest Trek. As always,
  the quality of KC''s prototypes are on par with many commercially produced games. 
  George clearly caught on quickly and managed to win this one.        Close-up of
  the board. The goal is to collect animals (into sets) by surrounding them with three
  tiles of the same color. Amun Re This was the one larger game I was able to play
  on Saturday, and is one of my favorites.  This was my first play with five players
  since the first time I ever played the game about a year ago.  I played a reasonably
  strong game, staying close to the lead at the end of the old age and hanging in
  to contend in the final age.  I was flush with income in the old age, but ended
  up being on the wrong side of the sacrifices second time around and spent my time
  struggling to keep up.  Fortunately I managed to draw a few build-for-two-bricks
  power cards, allowing me to stay ahead in the pyramid race on one side of the Nile.
  Dave had the opportunity to surpass me, but didn''t think I would be ahead of him
  at the end and took his chance on another card.  The card was worthless, and Dave
  and I ended up in a tie for second, one point behind Mike who won the game.  Tons
  of tension in this game as it came to a close - very enjoyable. Comments from Dave:
  Argh, I could have won if I were less aggressive with my final bid, or the bid before
  that one. No one ever contended much in the bidding rounds, despite many low bids.  I
  still don''t like this game. There''s not enough interaction, and the purchasing
  of items is busy work. Thumbs Down.        Dave, Chuck, Mike, KC, and I play Amun
  Re. Magic: the Gathering Erik was happy to take on all comers in Magic, and I''m
  fairly certain he won every match he played.        Jacob and Erik go at it in Magic.
  Heimlich & Co. This is a great Wolfgang Kramer, hidden information game. Peter,
  Ken and the boys all played. The green Spy was the first to 42 points, but was un-owned
  by any of the players, but Peter''s blue spy was next, winning the game (now how
  did they know, no-one was green?)        Peter, Ken, and the boys play Heimlich
  & Co. Magdar One of the FFG silver box line by Kevin Wilson (WarCraft). A light
  mining game, were the board slowly/(quickly) is destroyed. Peter added the Second
  Age Expansion which makes the 3 stone tile stronger and adds two new special tiles,
  and one additional row to the game, all of which lengthens the game (It needs it)
  . Ken, Brandon, Erik & Matthew dug away furiously but with four players this is
  very hard to control anything. In the end Brandon won going away.        Ken and
  Erik contemplate the board in Magdar. Tipsy Tower This was a new Goodwill find (Complete
  and unopened for $1.99) by Peter. This is a pretty good dexterity game, where you
  try to be the first to place all your men on the tower. This game has several chaotic
  elements, the men do not have flat bases, the tower has many levels and is top heavy
  (and adjustable) and the marble ballast moves. The result is can quickly spin out
  of control throwing men all over the place. Several games were played but the winners
  were not recorded.        Jacob and Brandon play Tipsy Tower. Die Mauer This was
  my final play of the day - Peter introduced this short game that has a key element
  that I''m learning to hate in some games.  Similar to Hoity Toity, this game is
  about guessing what your opponents will or won''t choose to do.  In the words of
  Dave, my only strategy in games like this is "I''ll play randomly." Comments from
  Dave: Never played this one before. My manipulation of the group psychology was
  masterful. g:-P The design is a bit too bared-bones for my tastes, but I''d play
  it again if asked. Thumbs Up.        We try and build our wall in Die Mauer. Linie
  1 This game was getting started as I left - no word on the final results. Comments
  from Dave: An old favorite of mine, but I''ve always played with the Streetcar ending
  rules. I much prefer the Linie 1 rule, as it gives you incentive to build long (and
  not necessarily direct) segments that don''t pass by any stops. Top Shelf.        Brandon,
  Chuck, Dave, and Ken play Linie 1.'
