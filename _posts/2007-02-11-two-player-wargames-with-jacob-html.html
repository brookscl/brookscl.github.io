excerpt: 'Jacob and I have been on a roll lately, playing Combat Commander: Europe
  twice and Command & Colors: Ancients three times over the past 2 weeks.  I''m most
  excited about CC:E, so let''s talk about that first. Coming on the heels of trying
  out ASL SK#1, CC:E hit the sweet spot the game Jacob and I were looking for. The
  card-driven nature of the game is the right solution to the ASL problem of "oh my
  there are so many choices I might have... how do I decide?"  This game is nowhere
  near the ease of play as C&C Ancients or Memoir ''44 - this is a real war game folks! 
  It has counters with little numbers on them, challenging timing rules, and concepts
  for routing and rallying similar to ASL. Still, we both found the game very approachable
  and fast-paced if not short.  Our games are averaging around 2 hours 30 minutes
  right now, though we may get it down to 2 hours with repeated play.  We started
  with the Fat Lipki first scenario, with Jacob playing the Germans and me the Russians.
    This scenario has a small number of units with both sides on recon.  One thing
  I really like about the game is the variable / hidden victory objectives which should
  greatly enhance replayability.  This time around we both had the main building (objective
  5) in the middle of the map as our secret objective so that''s where all the action
  was.  I snuck out a marginal victory of 3 points by surrounding Jacob from the woods
  across the road.  I also brought some units around the back side near his original
  starting point, which turned out to be a smart move as he marched a unit off my
  side of the board (that scores VPs for him) then brought him back in the next turn
  on his side.  I don''t quite see how that fits the simulation, but it is an interesting
  game mechanic. Our second game was scenario 2, with the Americans and Germans fighting
  it out in the hedgerows.  This really is a hopeless scenario for the Germans, but
  the starting conditions are balanced such that it is very playable.  We found this
  scenario to be much more engaging, especially because the units involved gave us
  more options from the cards (radio and artillery for Jacob as the Americans and
  some ordinance for the Germans).  This was another close game but in the end Jacob
  was able to overrun my position and get the requisite victory points.  I''m rating
  this a 9 after two plays.  Jacob and I are getting to be pros at C&C: Ancients,
  with most games finishing in less than 40 minutes.  Friday night we played the Lake
  Trasimenus scenario, with Jacob playing the Carthaginians and me the Romans.  This
  is a tough one for the Romans to win I think - or at least that''s going to be my
  ongoing defense as I can''t seem to beat Jacob in this game.  He won 6-3. Today
  we played back-to-back scenarios of Himera from the 1st expansion. This scenario
  pits the Carthaginians against Syracuse, and has a great setup: a Syracuse leader
  and cavalry sneak into the Carthaginian camp then proceed to wreak havoc.  Both
  of our games turned out to be decent simulations, with the Carthaginian camp getting
  nearly wiped out in both cases (I played Carthage both times) and solid counter-attacks
  from the right in both cases.  The first game was over fast, with Jacob taking all
  6 flags before I got my first.  I made a few serious tactical errors, attacking
  without room for retreat when I could have easily left myself some buffer.  On our
  second go-around I fared much better, losing 6-5.  I think I would have won had
  I delayed a counter-attack on the right and instead escaped with Hamilcar and the
  calvary from the camp on the left.  The three scenarios we played lasted 35, 30,
  and 40 minutes.  Setup time is down to about 10 minutes. So the real question is
  this: because we''re having so much fun with C&C: Ancients, should I even consider
  getting BattleLore?'
