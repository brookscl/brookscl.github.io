<p>A few weeks ago I got together with some local gaming friends to play <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization">Advanced Civilization</a>, an expansion released in 1991 for the base game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization">Civilization</a> which came out in 1980.  Even though I've been an active gamer since the late 1970s this was a first play for me.</p>
<p>Heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">computer game Civilization</a>? It is at least partly based on this core system.</p>
<p>My friend Chris organized multiple sessions at his house and helped get us newbies started with some learning tips:</p>

<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/324732/advanced-civilization-a-tome-on-trading-and-techno">Introductory Strategy Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The existing downloadable rulesets out there have many misprints and look to be an OCR of the printed book. I set out to do some cleanup and produce my own versions, which you can find here: <a href="/s/advcivrules.pdf">PDF version</a>, <a href="/s/advciv.epub">epub version</a>.  It looks like someone else out in BGG world has a similar idea as I just saw <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90812/rules-for-advanced-civilization">a new typeset version of the rules posted</a> which look quite nice.</p>
<p>So I played in a seven player game that lasted 12-ish hours, hung in there for a while and was perhaps in the top 3 early in the game, but ultimately finished last.  I didn't care -- it was a blast.</p>
<p>Next up is a four-player game that should happen this weekend with Jacob, Matthew, and friend Connor. We are going to play the <a href="http://www.drpetrov.com/games/Advanced%20Civilization/greece.htm">Glory that was Greece</a> four player map and variant. I printed an <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/73606/glory-that-was-greece-map">enhanced version of the map</a> on a 20"x30" photo poster at Costco and it looks nice.</p>
<p>Oh, forgot to mention how I got a copy of the game in the first place.  I purchased a used and worn copy of the original Civilization on eBay. To upgrade this to Advanced Civilization I needed new commodity and tech cards, and I found some decent options on the 'geek. I then used <a href="http://www.artscow.com/">ArtsCow</a> to print my custom decks.  Total cost (including the Costco map) was about $75.</p>
