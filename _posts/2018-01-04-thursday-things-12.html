<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<p>Just finished an around-the-USA travel in December (NY, Philadelphia, Florida, and Las Vegas) and played quite a few games. Here’s a recap.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2254" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/01/2017-12-16-11.29.32-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, more <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26232113">Advanced Squad Leader</a>.</li>
<li>I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26240901">Churchill</a> as a substitute for 18xx with my regular gaming partners Greg and Matt. Sadly we didn’t allow enough time to get through the entire game but it was a good learning game for both of them.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26259528">played The Napoleonic Wars</a> down in Monmouth right across the road from where I teach. This was with a group of folks organized by another professor at Western Oregon University. It was fun but ended after the first turn with a lucky die roll for the French. The rest of us played a game of chicken and we all lost.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26285084">I played 6 nimmt!</a> with family in NY.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26423760">I played Evolution</a> in Florida with my niece’s copy that she picked up on sale at Target. I don’t own this game any more, but playing it reminded me that this is a very good game.</li>
<li>Julie and I snuck in a play of <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26492466">Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</a> in between our Florida and Las Vegas trips. We are into September now so the year is closing down.</li>
<li>Jacob introduced us to <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26513399">Mint Works </a> while in Florida and we enjoyed this lightning fast and light worker placement game.</li>
<li>Jacob and Matthew also picked up <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26530257">Dicey Goblins</a> at a local game store in Vegas (designed by friend and Rainy Day Games owner Steve Ellis) and it came out quite a bit over the holiday week.</li>
<li>The highlight of the holiday gaming week was <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26540585">Charterstone</a>, which I purchased explicitly for this family week. Got a wide range of folks involved in the game and we are about halfway through the campaign. Julie and I will probably finish the campaign on our own, but not until we complete Pandemic.</li>
<li>I introduced my brother-in-law to <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26550753">Star Realms</a> which we played “live” a few times then moved into the digital iOS world where we are keeping a single game going indefinitely.</li>
<li>Jacob received <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26675370">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</a> in the Christmas yankee swap so that came out a few times. Sweet spot is three player I think, and we played in about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Jacob, Matthew, Kaitlin and I <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26707528">played a very tight game of Tichu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/23/565976012/first-listen-wilco-being-there-deluxe-edition-bonus-disc">First Listen: Wilco, ‘Being There: Deluxe Edition’ (Bonus Disc)</a> – Also, the re-issue of A.M. Honestly I can’t tell much difference in the remastered versions versus the originals, but this is worth a listen for the outtakes and extra demos.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned my reading of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2077458121?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Huế 1968: A Turning Point of the American War in Vietnam</a>. I have a harder time reading (vs. listening) to historical military narratives like this. Hope to listen to it someday.</li>
<li>Finished listening to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2178032109?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Alexander Hamilton</a> and it was outstanding.</li>
<li>I finished book 2 of the Locke Lamora series, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2242653489?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Red Seas Under Red Skies (Gentleman Bastard, #2)</a>, and it is my favorite so far. Pirates! Middle-aged moms who become pirates!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2017/12/01/task-management-for-coders/">Task management for coders</a> – I shared this with Jacob who is soon to enter the world of professional software development. This command-line driven approach with plain-old-text files is appealing.</li>
<li><a href="https://tim.blog/2017/11/18/under100/">Tribe of Mentors: Most Impactful Purchases of $100 or Less</a> – I found a gem or two here.</li>
