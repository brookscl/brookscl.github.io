<p>I just finished up a visit to the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT) Summit, and the photo you see are my three colleagues and I who all teach computer science at Western Oregon University. </p>
<p>While I learned much from the summit and speakers, most valuable were the discussions and forward progress the four of us made in our specific plans for improving our recruiting and retention of women at WOU.</p>
