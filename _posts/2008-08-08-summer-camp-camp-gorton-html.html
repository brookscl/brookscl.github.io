excerpt: 'The boys and I spent last week (hah! last month - can you tell how long
  it is taking me to get through the write/edit cycle for posts?) at Camp Gorton on
  Lake Waneta. We joined up with a local Bath, NY scout troop (Troop 59) and they
  were great hosts. I was one of the two assigned adult leaders for the troop so I
  was able to get some great interactions with the boys.  This was Jacob''s third
  summer camp and he decided to focus much of his time on the lifesaving merit badge,
  arguably one of the most difficult badges to earn in scouting. He had an amazing
  instructor and loved the experience. This is also a required merit badge for Eagle
  scout (he will be Life scout by the end of the month) so this puts him on track
  to finish Eagle by his 15th birthday.  He spent the afternoons earning his rifle
  shooting and orienteering merit badge. Jacob is a pretty good shot - scouts must
  demonstrate competence by "qualifying" at the range. Jacob was the first in camp
  to qualify, doing so on his second day there.  Matthew''s schedule mirrored Jacob''s
  - he spent the mornings on the waterfront earning swimming and rowing merit badge,
  then moving to the archery range in the afternoon followed by 1st aid. Matthew was
  also the first scout in camp to qualify for archery merit badge, completing his
  qualification on Wednesday.  Matthew had a doctor teaching his first aid merit badge,
  a great instructor who was great with kids.  This shot is of the dedication plaque
  at the archery range. If you look closely, you''ll see Lloyd Saxton on it - that''s
  Julie''s grandfather. He made a contribution to their fundraising campaign in the
  80s and the mark is still there. '
