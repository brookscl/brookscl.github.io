excerpt: I just learned today that a friend and fellow gamer, Jason Sato, passed away
  this afternoon after suffering a stroke while gaming last night at the Game Depot
  inTempe, AZ.  Jason was not a close friend of mine, but I did experience several
  spectacular gaming sessions with him during visits do Arizona.  I always found him
  to be warm, welcoming, and highly intelligent.  My condolences to his close friends
  and family.
