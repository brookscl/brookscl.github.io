excerpt: 'I''m back in San Francisco - it has been a crazy week:          Nice photo
  from the top of a downtown SFO building.  Tue - in Columbus, OH visiting customers.  Wed
  - traveled to Los Angeles (Ontario actually).  Thu - Gave a brief talk at the California
  Bankers Association Annual Electronic Commerce Conference in Ontario.  Jumped on
  another plane to head to San Francisco for a reprise.  Fri - Will give the same
  talk at the northern Cal episode of the conference.  Fly back to Portland.  I was
  in San Francisco last week for our board meeting.  I took this photo from the office
  building of one of our board members - amazing view from there of most of downtown
  SFO.  Will be nice to get back home - baseball games for both of the boys on Friday
  night, some gaming on Saturday, and an anniversary dinner Saturday night (12 years!). '
