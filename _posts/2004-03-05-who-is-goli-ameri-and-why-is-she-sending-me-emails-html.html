excerpt: 'I usually avoid public political debates, but I can''t resist this one. 
  In the past week I have received two emails from Ameri For Congress 2004, and I
  have no idea how I got on her email list.  Whether or not I agree with her views
  is irrelevant in this case, because I have two serious concerns:  The email was
  unsolicited.  If I somehow got on a list that she feels is authorized to use, she
  should specify such in her email. The email contains no opt-out instructions. I''m
  all for candidates using appropriate media to get their message out, but this is
  clearly in the spam category and I''m pretty furious.'
