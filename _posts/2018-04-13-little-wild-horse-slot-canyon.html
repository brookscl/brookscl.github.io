<p>While hanging around Hanksville and Goblin Valley, Julie and I kept hearing about a fun and easy slot canyon nearby. So we delayed our exploration of Capitol Reef for a day and hiked the 8 mile loop including Bell Canyon. It was a great hike though the water was over our knees at a few points because of rain the night before. We were prepared with water shoes.</p>
