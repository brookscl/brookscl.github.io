excerpt: " I'm here in the Messe hanging out in smoke-filled hall 4A between 4 and
  5. Sorry for the lack of posts, but it is such a non-stop craze that it is hard
  to find time to even sit down for 5 minutes.  So far the day has been great (it
  is 6pm here). Havoc continues to be our best seller and we've nearly sold out of
  our remaining supply, including the expansions we brought. 24/7 is gaining momentum
  but wasn't the first day hit that Havoc was last year. The good news is that when
  people sit down to try it we almost always convert the demo into a sale.  Games
  I purchased today (I'm on about a $300 budget this year):   Through the Ages - automatic
  purchase from the Czech Games dudes Turfmaster Deluxe - this is my big buy at 69
  euro, but the game is a blast and I love the components. The Experiment - a cool
  little Belgian card game that won a design competition and got a free 1000 copy
  print run from Carta Mundi. 3 copies each of Pickomino and Cartagena for my games
  class - all of the above for a total of about 50 euro. A bunch of small stuff for
  Peter Loop and Mike Deans. Astoria - I don't care if the game is good... 20 euro
  for an engraved wooden box with 4 glass bottles and gems in it. Great value for
  bits. I pre-ordered the three train games / expansions from Winsome and picked those
  up today for 75 euro.  One highlight of the week so far is spending an hour in Reiner
  Knizia's hotel room getting pitched about 6 of his games for possible publication
  by Sunriver. We are going to try out 3 of them.  We've had great support from our
  demo team, and many fans have come back to say hi after purchasing Havoc last year.
  Most ask where my family is :-(.  Hard to tell what the big buzz of the show is.
  On the Underground is getting some hype but reviews are mixed from the folks I talked
  to. Gloria Mundi and Perikles look pretty nice. I have room for 1 or 2 more games
  so I'll be picky and get something on Sat or Sun.  I'll try and get another report
  out tomorrow!Â  Check out some photos over at Flickr - I'll keep adding to the set."
