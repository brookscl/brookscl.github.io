excerpt: I've been busy lately. About one month ago I joined WebMD Health Services
  as their new VP of Technology. I'm responsible for product development, customer
  integration, and hosting operations for the private portal business for employers,
  health plans, and providers. I have an amazing team to work with and great support
  from the executive management team. We are running fast with no signs of slowing
  down soon, so there may be limited posting here for a while. Football season is
  wrapping up today (check out my latest post over on A Football Coach in Sherwood)
  so hopefully some evenings and weekends will start opening up again for periodic
  gaming.
