excerpt: 'I finally found some time for gaming last Saturday and spent the evening
  at Kevin Graham''s, "connector" of all us spielfrieks here in the Portland area. 
  I''ve met most of my favorite gaming folks through Kevin, and I know we all appreciate
  his efforts to create a fun environment and a thriving gaming community in this
  city. It was a fairly small crowd this Saturday, but we had a special guest: Mike
  Oakes from the UK.  He is in our neck of the woods for a 2 week RV tour of Oregon. 
  Doug, Mimi, Sabrina, and Greg were also present. Quicksand I brought this at Kevin''s
  request (along with Capt''n Clever and Aladdin''s Dragons) and we decided it would
  be a nice opener.  This is my second play, and I''m still not sure about this one. 
  It is a nice opener, very light, but with 5 players (we were still waiting for Doug
  and Mimi) there isn''t much deception involved.  In Quicksand players are secretly
  trying to advance their adventurer to the treasure.  Advancement is achieved by
  playing cards of the same color as an adventurer, and most of the time a player
  is forced to move someone else along.  With 5 players only one of the tokens does
  not belong to a player, so bluffing is frought with disaster.  I suppose there''s
  some strategy in moving players onto the quicksand whenever possible.  In this game,
  we all got bottlenecked at the end of the board, and Sabrina was forced to move
  the leader into the treasure since that was her only legal move.  I don''t remember
  who the winner was - maybe Kevin?  I''ll rate this one a 5. Volldampf Doug remembered
  that I had been wanting to play this game since trying Age of Steam and was kind
  enough to bring his copy of the game along.  I''ve heard from several others that
  they prefer this game to the newer Age of Steam, and I can see why.  Volldampf is
  certainly a simpler game, and it keeps the features I like most about Age of Steam
  (route planning and cooperation).  The board routes are fixed (in AoS they are built
  out by players), trains can carry goods up to 6 segments from the start (in AoS
  you have to pay money to upgrade your engine), and there''s no income reduction. 
  We played this in about 90 minutes (including teaching) and I loved it.  It helped
  that I won (I got very lucky with two of the final goods placements) - Doug finished
  a close second.  I''ll score this one a 9 for now. Aladdin''s Dragons I helped Sabrina,
  Mike, and Kevin get started with this game - I wrote about it previously here. 
  Kevin doesn''t much like auction games, but I think he had a fun time with this
  one.  Sabrina managed to pull out the victory, from what I here she took advantage
  of the spell cards. Bang! I talked everyone into trying a 7 player game of Bang!,
  which I first tried at GenCon.  I don''t think this game works very well with 4
  players, but I absolutely love it with 7.  For the second time in three games, the
  sheriff (Sabrina) helped dispose of the deputy.  This light game is made even more
  fun by the social interaction and bluffing.  I''ll rate this one an 8.'
