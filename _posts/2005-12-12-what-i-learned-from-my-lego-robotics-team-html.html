excerpt: Don’t expect anything too earth shattering here, but it is an important lesson
  about the power of simplicity. I volunteered to coach a Lego Robotics team for Jacob’s
  school back in September, with Jacob on the team along with 5 other 4th and 5th
  graders.  The team has been meeting weekly ever since, working on their solution
  to the Challenge 2005 – Ocean Odyssey.  I took a very hands-off approach with the
  team, focusing on facilitating their own design and decision-making process by giving
  them some basic tools.  We started with simple exercises to get familiar with programming
  and controlling the robot and gradually worked into the mission challenges.  Eventually
  they settled on four of the missions after prioritizing based on points and complexity.
  Last Sunday was the big day – the competition where they joined 23 other teams (elementary
  and middle school) at Mentor Graphics HQ for the challenge.  While the team had
  to give a presentation on some challenge we face with our oceans, the focus was
  definitely on the mission challenges with the robot.  They had three chance to get
  their best score – each chance is a 2.5 minute trial where they attempt to complete
  as many missions as possible.  Given that the team only prepared to do 4 of the
  missions, their maximum possible score was going to be 156.  The highest score for
  the day was about 310, with most teams scoring 125 or below.  Their first trial
  saw them getting two of their four missions completed, scoring 89 points.  The second
  trial was the highlight, with the robot completing all four missions and the only
  downside being a 2 point penalty for retrieving the robot away from base (this was
  to rescue it from doing something that would have cost them one of their missions
  – a great reaction).  Their score was 154.  You should have seen the looks on their
  faces!  So what did I learn from the team?  They reaffirmed my belief in the power
  of simplicity, the elegance of design for function without clutter.  Their robot
  as designed likely could not have solved all of the mission challenges, but for
  the four they achieved it performed magnificently.  There were no moving parts other
  than the wheels and they designed their solutions with a high degree of fault tolerance. 
  They also built in an approach to running the robot that greatly increased the odds
  of success.  If any of these kids participate next year I think they will likely
  move to more complex solutions designed to address more of the challenges (hinging
  arms, retractable hooks, etc.) but I’m thrilled with how they approached the challenge
  this year.
