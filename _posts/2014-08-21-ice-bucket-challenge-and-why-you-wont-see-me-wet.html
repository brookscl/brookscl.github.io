<p>My son Matthew made a hilarious video of him being doused while hanging upside down on a pull-up bar, and he called me out to take the <a href="http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html">ALS Ice Bucket Challenge</a>. I will not being taking the challenge but will be donating $100 today to ALS.</p>
