excerpt: While I haven't had much time for gaming lately, the time I have made has
  been very good. Some meaty games and old gems that don't hit the table very often.
  A few weeks ago the boys and I broke out Attack! with the expansion. Besides Nexus
  Ops (which we play when we want something shorter), Attack! is probably our favorite
  Ameritrash multi-player conflict game. It has a nice steady build-up, enough resource
  management to keep it strategic, and a fun but bizarre alternative-history view
  of WWII. The game must be played with the expansion in our opinion, and we may consider
  getting the the Attack deluxe expansion at some point. In the good old days, Jacob
  and Matthew would go at each other's throats while I sat back and cleaned up the
  scraps. No more - the boys made a secret alliance against me and knocked me out
  early. Jacob held off Matthew for the victory. I think the game took about 2-3 hours
  total. While Jacob was away at Philmont, Matthew and I were digging for something
  a bit deeper to play. Matthew has stayed away from wargames heavier than Memoir
  '44, but given his affinity for Lord of the Rings I thought War of the Ring might
  be a good next step for him. This is a game I absolutely adore but play too infrequently
  to quickly start, though this time around the rules came back to me more quickly
  and I'm starting to see the simplicity of the system. Matthew played the Shadow
  and I the fellowship.  Matthew was slow going on the military side, taking too long
  to siege Minas Tirith and get the Shadow armies rolling north. Still, I played fast
  and loose with the Fellowship, spinning off companions early and running as quickly
  as possible to Mordor. I pushed things a bit too hard (relative to Matthew's military
  buildup) and found myself in Mordor with a tad too much corruption to handle. I
  had to slow down a bit in hopes of getting some cards to help me heal corruption,
  but the rules force you to slog ahead even if slowly. In the end it came down to
  the last two tile draws - Matthew managed to draw the only tile in the bag that
  did not advance the fellowship just as I was sitting on the doorstep of destroying
  the ring, then on the next tile draw I had only a 1/3 change of surviving and alas
  I didn't. Score one for Sauron. Matthew loved it and hopefully we'll try again soon.
  Last weekend Ken and Eric came over to join Jacob and me in a long overdue game
  of Roads and Boats. We used one of Sterling Babcock's fine scenarios that allowed
  the players to get rolling with minimal interaction, but forced some competition
  at mid-game for the mining resources in the middle.  Jacob is a natural at this
  game and spanked us all pretty badly. Eric and I both made poor decisions on our
  mining upgrades which kept us even further back. I quick-played the endgame by building
  out the wonder but that netted me a solid 4th place. It didn't help that my deep
  mine yielded three consecutive ore tiles - even one gold would have gained me 3rd
  place, and three gold 2nd. As I told the group, I love this game even when I finish
  last. Jacob, Matthew, and I plan to play a three player game this coming Sunday.
