<h3 id="whatimdrinking">What I’m Drinking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tried the beer Danko Rye IPA at Steuben Brewing Company on June 14 2017. Gave it a rating of 3.75. Cloudy, some sweetness, not much in the way of citrus. I like it enough to fill up my beer share growler. With friends coming in town this weekend I’m sure we’ll be hitting all of the Keuka Lake breweries.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li>I Finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2013069004?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, #1)</a> and am onto the next book. Enjoying it for the light summer reading it is.</li>
<li>Finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2012644111?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Buddhism Is Not What You Think: Finding Freedom Beyond Beliefs</a> – truly, I dumped it. Too preachy and not the kind of introduction I was looking for. The book was almost whining at me.</li>
<li><a href="https://standardebooks.org/about/">Standard Ebooks</a> – This is “meta” (i.e., <em>about</em> books) but I like the project. Typography and layout <strong>matter</strong> in eBooks and I like what they are doing here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/06/12/530277867/first-listen-jason-isbell-the-400-unit-the-nashville-sound">First Listen: Jason Isbell &amp; The 400 Unit, ‘The Nashville Sound’</a> – Loving this band. How did I not know about them sooner?</li>
<li>The Cool Jazz station on Amazon Music. This has become my go-to focus music while working in my short sprints.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.frugalwoods.com/2015/08/07/the-great-homemade-seltzer-discovery-of-2015/">The Great Homemade Seltzer Discovery of 2015</a> – I’m thinking about ways to substitute for beer when I get back to Oregon in August. I’d like to limit drinking to just the weekends, and soda water might be just the trick. This is a way to get it cheaper, though you gotta hide the tank!</li>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/cats-are-an-extreme-outlier-among-domestic-animals/">Cats are an extreme outlier among domestic animals</a> – People who live with cats like to joke about how these small fuzzy creatures are still wild, basically training us rather than the other way around. Now a new genetic study of ancient cat DNA reveals that we are basically right.</li>
<li><a href="http://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/">The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency — Nick Szabo</a> – Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) is a polymath. The breadth and depth of his interests and knowledge are truly astounding. He’s a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer best known for his pioneering research in digital contracts and cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h3>
<ul>
<li>I played <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion">Dominion</a> this week with Julie, Matthew, and a neighbor. It went over well and I think Julie is enkoying it more.</li>
<li>Julie, Matthew, and I played <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1472/five-crowns">Five Crowns</a> - this is our go-to filler game.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gmtgames.com/p-648-fort-sumter-the-secession-crisis-1860-61.aspx">Fort Sumter: The Secession Crisis, 1860–61</a> – Not really playing this yet, but excited to see this one show up on GMT’s P500 list. I already pre-ordered it; love his designs.</li>
</ul>
