excerpt: 'The time is quickly approaching where I''ll board a Lufthansa flight here
  in Portland to join a bunch of my partners and friends for the trek to Essen.  Sunriver
  Games will again have a booth at the fair (hall 4, booth 69) and we''ll be selling
  24/7: the Game, Abagio, Havoc: the Hundred Years War, and the Havoc Expansion. Preparing
  for the show has been nowhere near as involved and tiring as last year.  Ludo Fact
  handled all of the final production for 24/7 and the first set of copies will be
  delivered directly to our booth.  Quite a bit easier than hand assembling, shrinkwrapping,
  and carting the games to Essen in our luggage. Not to say that we don''t need to
  bring any games with us.  We are going to take about 35 copies of Abagio and KC
  came up with the brilliant idea of packing 4 Havocs inside each Abagio box (yes,
  there''s an excess of air in the box).  This will allow us to bring about 100 copies
  of Havoc (supply is dwindling, and what we have leftover after the show will be
  sold through Funagain).  There are currently no plans for a reprint though we will
  reconsider in 2007. We have a few special promotions going on at the show:  We are
  giving away some very nice "Gamers Do It 24/7" buttons to folks that try a demo
  of 24/7: the Game at our booth. We will be giving away the very cool Start Spieler
  spinning fingers to folks that spend 20€ or more at our booth. We are running some
  24/7 contests and raffle giveaways of a very nice handmade wooden board for the
  game.  We will also raffle off some spiffy Sunriver Games t-shirts. We also managed
  to pack our buttons and the Havoc Expansion into the dead space in the Abagio boxes.  Carey
  purchased three travel trunks to cart all of the goods.  With my Star Alliance Gold
  status, I should be able to check all three of the trunks without any extra cost
  with Lufthansa.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) this should give us lots of space
  to pack up purchased games on the home trip.  If you are heading to the show, you
  might enjoy listening to my segment in the Dice Tower, episode 23 where I talk about
  10 things you need to know about going to Essen.  See you at the show!'
