<p>We arrived at the park at 6:45am and caught the first shuttle, allowing us to be two of the first 10 people to the summit. Not nearly as difficult as the climb to Observation Point but likely more frightening for many. Iâ€™ll share some photos relating the climbing experience in my next post.</p>
