excerpt: 'I travelled to the Seattle/Redmond area this week for business, and managed
  to squeeze in some late-night gaming on Wednesday evening.  Tom Powers from Boards
  & Bits was kind enough to invite me to join his group, a collection of mostly Microsofties.
  Alhambra I requested this before my arrival, having played it once on BSW I was
  eager to see it in real life.  It certainly is a pretty game, and has some interesting
  purchasing mechanics.  The goal of the game is to build a courtyard out of tiles
  and gain majorities in as many different colors/styles of buildings as possible. 
  There are walls on the tiles which also factor into scoring, as players get points
  for the number of connected outer wall segments.  Walls also constrain the building
  of tiles, since every open space must be connected to the center of the courtyard
  (i.e., no walling off).        Dave, Tom, and Sharry playing Alhambra. On a player''s
  turn they may either pick up some money (there are four different types of currency)
  or purchase a building.  To purchase a building, you must pay at least the value
  of the building in the specified currency.  If you are able to pay the exact amount,
  you get to take another action.  If you are forced to pay over the amount, you don''t
  get change and your turn is ended.  One of the key strategies of the game is accumulating
  the best set of currency that will give you flexibility when purchasing.        Final
  scoring in Alhambra.  I had a small comeback finishing third, but Sharry was the
  final winner. This game is fun, but for a few reasons I doubt I''ll purchase it. 
  First, there are some human factors issues - too many colors at play, with color
  schemes for both building types and the different currencies.  I found myself checking
  and rechecking my hand and the buildings for sale to see if I could purchase them. 
  Others in the group shared similar concerns.  Second, the luck factor is a bit too
  high for me.  The game can swing greatly in one player''s favor depending on both
  currency and building draws.  This is true of many games, but for some reason it
  bothered me more in this game. Tichu I didn''t play Tichu, but one group of four
  played for a few hours and seemed to be having a lot of fun.  I haven'' played this
  game, but I do enjoy trick taking games and have played a few that are similar to
  this (like Gang of Four).        Tichu was played most of the evening by this group.
  Penny Stock Dave then brought out his prototype of a simple stock trading game. 
  Tom, Nick, Sharry, Dave, and I played.        Dave ponders market dynamics over
  his prototype Penny Stock. This is a fun little game.  The game plays in four trading
  days.  At the start of each day, each player decides whether to sell short (hope
  the stocks go down) or long (stocks go up) for the day.  Within the trading day,
  players accumulate stock cards for 1 of 8 companies in 4 different sectors.  Each
  player in turn plays action cards which affect the market, sending stocks up or
  down.  The action cards are designed to be balanced (i.e., net zero change if you
  sum them together), but since they often give players choices of which stocks to
  send up or down, each game will play differently.  At the end of the trading day,
  players earn money based on how far their stocks climbed or fell, multiplied by
  the number of shares held of those stocks.        Final scoring - I finished fourth
  (black). I enjoyed the game, though there was some discussion afterwards about some
  ways to make the scoring less linear.  It seems to easy for one player to pull very
  far ahead if the stock goes up a 5 or 6 notches.  A few ideas were shared, including
  income reduction (ala Age of Steam), a progressive daily tax (i.e., the more you
  make the more % tax you pay), or a non-linear trading scale (similar to Acquire). 
  Hopefully I''ll get a chance to play this again after he tweaks it. Attika A few
  of us diehards stayed to play Attika, the game of city-state building on the Greek
  peninsula.  The game is gorgeous and was my favorite of the night.  There are two
  ways to win - build all of your buildings, or build a contiguous string of buildings
  between two temples.  Buildings are built using a typical resource model (like Settlers
  of Catan), but there are some interesting tweaks that make this game much more interesting:  There
  are resources on the board that can be used by placing a building on top of or adjacent
  to the resource.  For example, if a building costs three mountains and one hill,
  and it gets built on a mountain adjacent to another mountain and hill, then the
  player only needs to play one landscape card from his hand. There are tech trees
  for the different groups of buildings, and if you build in the right sequence, chaining
  buildings together, then buildings can be placed for free.        Nick enjoys a
  game of Attika. I didn''t do too well in this first playing.  Tom made a comment
  at the start of the game that it is rare to connect two temples unless playing with
  newbies.  I suppose he was right, because he ended up winning in this manner!  He
  was closing in on his second temple from two different directions, and I was scrambling
  to cut him off.  In doing so, I also cut off Nick, preventing him from supporting
  me. I liked this game so much I purchased it the next day from Boards & Bits.  Julie
  and I played a two-player game Friday evening - the rules are very simple and easy
  to teach.'
