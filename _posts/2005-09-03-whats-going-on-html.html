excerpt: Nearly two years ago I had the pleasure of joining the Westbank Gamers for
  a night of gaming while on a business trip to New Orleans.  Greg Schloesser was
  kind enough to extend the invitation to me – I found Greg and his group to be incredibly
  warm and gracious.  Today Greg posted a note from fellow Westbank Gamer (Greg isn’t
  technically a Westbank Gamer any more as he moved to Tennessee, but clearly his
  heart still belongs in New Orleans) giving a personal account of what’s happening
  in New Orleans right now.  Dear Lord, help us for others have not. What is going
  on? Where are you? I'm at a loss for words. Please help us! Louisiana is one of
  the most generous states per capital income in the United States. After the World
  Trade Center bombing in New York, members of New Orleans went to New York and cooked
  for the workers and we also donated fire equipment to New York. Most people in New
  Orleans would give the shirt off their back if you just asked them.  There are now
  people dying of dehydration in and around the city of New Orleans. The News Media
  has found it entertaining to show people stealing TV and stereo equipment and other
  valuables (which are actually very few). The News Media seems to enjoy watching
  people beg for help as they fly by. News Media if you're not part of the solution
  then your part of the problem. The actual truth is people are breaking into homes
  and stealing to get food and water for their children and not for valuables. People
  are dying of dehydration and are starving right here in America It is true about
  people trying to rush to your vehicle and take it, but when you're left with no
  option you too would do what it took to save you family.  We are being told that
  no one is in charge. The Jefferson Parish Officials are stuck on the West Bank of
  New Orleans at West Jefferson Medical Center with minimal resources for the only
  functioning emergency room in the New Orleans area. The officials are begging and
  pleading for the military or Red Cross to come and help but no one is listening
  to them. You ask how I know this. My sister-in-law is stuck there also (she is an
  RN) and she has been communicating with us. You would not believe the horror stories
  she is telling us. One poor woman went into labor in 4 ½ feet of water with numerous
  dead bodies floating around her. Someone miraculously got her to West Jefferson
  Medical Center where she had to have an emergency C-section. Yesterday, Sept 1,
  2005, I snuck back in to the Westbank of New Orleans to check on my property and
  my tenants. Knowing my tenants and their finances, my greatest fears were realized
  when I pulled up to my partially roofless fourplex and saw Miss Martha standing
  at the top of the steps. The first words out of her mouth were "Mr. Moore I don't
  have your rent money right now, but I will get it to you as soon as I can. Obviously
  I do not rent to wealthy people, but I do rent to good people. I almost started
  to cry seeing how she was living. My tenants downstairs were in a much worse position.
  Their apartment had received two feet of water during the hurricane. Even though
  the second floor was missing part of the roof, they asked me if it would be alright
  to break into the upstairs apartment to get food and water and a some what dry place
  to stay. I now ask you how you would answer that question. I must ask where is the
  Red Cross; the Westbank of New Orleans is now dry. (Please help us). If I could
  get there, so could they. I was able to give her and the others all of the water
  I had.  You may have seen our largest mall on the Westbank burned to the ground.
  Why was it burned? People were misinformed – they were told to gather at the mall
  to receive food and water. After two days of waiting, a riot escalated to the burning
  of the mall.  Why can't the simple necessities be brought to these people. People
  who have evacuated would love to return to bring in water and food, but they are
  not letting anyone in.  My brother-in-law is now taking my hurricane-damaged truck
  back to the city to see if he can pick up his brother-in-law in St. Bernard Parish.
  He has been working the last four days in a makeshift morgue stacking bodies. He
  asked us if we could please come get him since they too are low on water and food.
  I don't believe they will get there, but it is at least worth the try. My personal
  home was also flooded with about 1 to 2 feet of water in Algiers (the West Bank
  of New Orleans). My father's home in Harvey was flooded and severely damaged. I
  was unsuccessful at getting to my Help-U-Sell office on Clearview Parkway, so I'm
  unsure of its condition. I do not know what the future holds for my family, but
  I'm sure with God's help we will survive. I do feel blessed because numerous have
  lost their lives and everyone in my family is safe.  The latest thing we are hearing
  is that some national politicians are saying that the country should not rebuild
  the city of New Orleans. I realize that the country got a bad view of the city with
  all of the looting and unrest after the storm. That was only a handful of people.
  Most of our people are good, hardworking, and honest and what was seen on the tv
  is not representative of the majority. The people of our good state will survive
  and rise. New Orleans is made up of people of Cajun and Creole descent who have
  been faced with adversity in the past. New Orleans will be rebuilt regardless of
  what the national politicians wish.
