excerpt: Julie and I spent the weekend in St. Louis visiting our alma mater, Washington
  University.  The last time I visited was in 1995 at a five year class reunion, but
  Julie and I decided it was time to return and join a special celebration.  I was
  a member of Thurtene, the junior honorary, a group of thirteen students chartered
  each year with putting on the Thurtene Carnival.  This is presumably the oldest
  and largest student-run carnival in the United States.  Members are selected early
  in their junior year and spend the next 4–6 months doing the prep work for the carnival. 
  It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my college years. The campus has
  changed significantly for the better since my time there, with the most dramatic
  changes being the residential area, aka the “South 40”.  What used to be a collection
  of boring 60s and 70s-style cement buildings has turned into a terraced landscape
  of classic brick buildings and winding pathways.  Gone are the ugly skyscrapers
  (and firetraps) and one-by-one they are taking down the older dormitories and replacing
  them with buildings much more in step with the architecture of the campus.  Some
  things never change though, making our visit an exciting blend of revisiting old
  familiar spaces and discovering new aspects of this beautiful university.  Thankfully,
  student groups still paint the underpass with event advertisements – losing that
  would have been a hard pill to swallow.  Our reason for coming this weekend went
  beyond just attending the carnival – the faculty advisor for Thurtene, Coach Jim
  Burmeister, is stepping down from his role after serving in that capacity for 35
  years.  I swear he hasn’t aged a day since serving as our advisor in 1989, and members
  from his 1st years back in the 70s affirmed that their view was consistent with
  mine.  We had a spectacular turnout from our year, with seven members making the
  trip from all corners of the US (Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, and St.
  Louis).  There’s something special about a group charged with a single monumental
  task each year (putting on a carnival to raise funds for a children’s charity) that
  maintains a level of continuity that far surpasses most institutions we encounter
  in our lives.  While the names change every year (as does the makeup of the organization
  – it went from all men to co-ed in 1992), the traditions stay the same largely due
  to the adept guidance of an individual like Coach.  Thanks Coach for your loyalty
  and dedication to Thurtene these past 35 years.  Thanks to my fellow Thurtene 1989
  for creating and sharing one of my most memorable college experiences.  Finally,
  thanks to those current and future members of Thurtene that will carry the tradition
  forward.

<p>Our reason for coming this weekend went beyond just attending the carnival - the faculty advisor for Thurtene, Coach Jim Burmeister, is stepping down from his role after serving in that capacity for <em>35 years</em>.  I swear he hasn't aged a day since serving as our advisor in 1989, and members from his 1st years back in the 70s affirmed that their view was consistent with mine.</p>
