excerpt: 'Mark wrote a very insightful post about his recent experiences at the Gathering. 
  Even though I''ve lobbied for an invite, it would take some serious thought before
  I would attend due to the time (opportunity) cost.  My vacation time is precious
  and losing 5 days that could be spent with the family would be tough. Oh, and Mark:
  I would have watched the basketball playoff game with you!'
