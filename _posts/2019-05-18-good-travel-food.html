<p>We've almost made it to our destination (Keuka Lake NY) and I thought I'd share some of the tasty food we've had along the way. First up was at <a href="https://chauhannashville.com/">Chauhan Ale &amp; Masala House</a> in Nashville.  Pictured above are their gol guppa shots, a creative and very tasty appetizer. You pour the mint cilantro water into the bowl and eat in one bite. So good. Apparently tequila is also an option.</p>
<p>We also enjoyed some fine dining at <a href="https://husknashville.com/">Husk</a> in Nashville. I had catfish and some shrimp &amp; grits but Julie was the big winner with her vegan plate. Shitake mushrooms that tasted like bacon.</p>

<p>Not quite fine dining but check out the pancake club sandwich. This is from <a href="https://www.marysdiner.com/">Mary's Diner</a> in Geneva OH. Half saved for tomorrow's breakfast.</p>
