excerpt: SimplyFun is a relatively new game company with a novel business model –
  direct sales of games through SimplyFun independent consultants (similar to Tupperware
  and others) that come to your home for a party to demonstrate and play their games. 
  SimplyFun has a recognizable leadership team and since their launch I’ve been curious
  to see both the business model and games in action.  So, back in July I went to
  the website and expressed an interest in hosting a party.  Within a few days Amy
  Ellis was in touch with me to schedule the event, also providing some good tips
  on planning and preparing a guest list.  Amy (and her husband Steve) are also part
  owners of the local game shop Rainy Day Games.  I used the handy eVite online service
  to invite friends and track attendance. Last night was the night for the party,
  and I had 10 people confirmed to attend (some game group regulars, work friends,
  and local friends).  Knowing that the games from SimplyFun were of the, ahem, lighter
  sort I wasn’t very confident any of the die-hards would show up from the RipCity
  group – Mike Deans and Ken Rude both accommodated though and at least one of them
  had a good time. Most of you are probably interested in the games, so I’ll dive
  in and share my experiences with each. The event went well, people had fun and bought
  product (I think a total of over $400 worth), and at least a few expressed an interest
  in hosting their own event in the future. Amy started us off with Linkity, a word
  association game.  Each player is dealt a hand of cards with single letters on them,
  and the start player lays down a card and says a word that starts with the letter
  on that card.  The hand then proceeds in real-time, with players laying down cards
  by free associating with the prior word.  An example might be “Leg”, “Foot”, “Meter”,
  “Water”.  If at any point a player feels that an association is inappropriate or
  too much of a stretch, the player can challenge and call for a vote.  If the challenge
  is upheld, the offending player takes back the card and draws two more.  If the
  other players disagree with the challenger, then the challenger must draw two more
  cards.  The hand is over when a player runs out of cards, with each other player
  scoring points equal to the number of cards left in her hand.  I rate the game “OK”,
  probably about a 6 or so – a fun party game but not much in the box to make it a
  compelling purchase.  I could probably just use my set of Alpha Cards to play the
  game. Next up was Handy, a dexterity game described as “Twister for your hands”. 
  The game comes with a set of 30 different balls that players try to suspend between
  pairs fingers from adjacent players based on cards that are drawn.  I didn’t play
  this one, but after observation I decided it wouldn’t make my purchase list.  Again,
  too little to the game to grab my interest.  Next up was Walk the Dogs, a cute little
  set collection game with some creative mechanics.  The game comes with 63 dogs of
  about 7–8 different types that get randomly put into a chain (head to tail) of dogs
  in the center of the table.  Players alternatively collect dogs from this central
  chain by playing cards that allow them to take dogs from the front, back or both
  ends of the chain and put them into their own personal chain.  The goal is to build
  contiguous sets of the same types of dogs in your personal chain – these sets score
  the square of the length of the set.  There’s risk in keeping these sets open on
  your chain, however, as there are cards that force players to discard their longest
  exposed set on the end of a chain.  This game was the first hit of the party, I
  think because of a combination of the cute little doggies and a more interesting
  game.  This one went right onto my purchase list. I surprised Amy by requesting
  (several times) that she bring and we play TuneBaya, a lyrics and singing party
  game.  This one is designed by Peter Sarrett and Michael Adams and, while it won’t
  be at the top of everyone’s list, for groups that enjoy singing and music this is
  a great party game.   The game is played over eight rounds, each round starting
  with a card draw where a player chooses one of two song topics.  Players then write
  down the title of a song that includes the topic word or category in its lyrics,
  followed by grabbing a small microphone from the middle of the table (there is one
  fewer microphone than the number of players, like when playing spoons).  Once each
  of the microphones is taken, the player who first took a microphone sings his song. 
  Other players join in the song if they know it as well, but at least 10 words of
  the song must be sung in order to score points.  If one or more other players wrote
  down the same song title, each of those players gets a five point bonus.  Each player
  that joins in the song also gets a bonus point, and the player that wrote down the
  song title gets a point for each other player that joined in.  So if there were
  five players in the game, and another player wrote down the same song title as I,
  and four players in total sang along, I would score the five point bonus plus four
  points for a total of 9 points.  The other player that wrote down the same song
  would also score 9 points.  Obscurity does not pay off in this game, a key point
  that will likely keep me from ever winning this game.  It was great fun though and
  jumped right onto my purchase list. Those that were not interested in singing played
  the word game Plext over in the kitchen. I still don’t know much about the game,
  but comments were favorable from those that tried it.  The goal seems to be to build
  the shortest possible words that use a sequence of letters in succession, where
  you are allowed to plug in your own letters in between the letters shown on the
  board.   Our last SimplyFun game of the night was Eye to Eye.  This is a game of
  categories where you try and come up with specific examples within a category (like
  “Soap Brands”, or “Shades of Red”) that you think other people will come up with
  as well.  Again, obscurity does not pay in this game.  The scoring mechanism is
  quite cool but a bit gratuitous – there are wooden cubes that you collect when you
  score points (points are bad) and you build them into a pyramid.  When your pyramid
  is complete, or if all of the scoring blocks are gone, the game is over.   This
  is a great light party game that should be popular for family gatherings.  I’m purchasing
  it and it should find some decent amount of play out at the coast. Thanks to Amy
  and all my friends for making this party a success.  I wish SimplyFun lots of success
  – it looks to be a solid business model and hopefully they and their consultants
  can make some money while spreading the word about family gaming.
