excerpt: 'Life is a bit less hectic these days, which means gaming activity has picked
  up. I’ve managed to host a few different gaming sessions and even attended one at
  Mike’s last week. Let’s recap: Dominant Species Jacob and I played a two player
  game of this after Thanksgiving, playing one species each. As many have said, the
  rules are clear and concise, components are outstanding, and I think there’s a good
  game in there. Unfortunately I suspect it isn’t optimized for two players, two species.
  If we try it again with two, we’ll each play two species to introduce more competition
  and flavor. The mechanics remind me a bit of the Splotter game Bus - plot your moves
  out for the turn, and pay close attention to the sequencing and what your opponents
  are choosing. I supposed you could say the same about Agricola, Pillars of the Earth,
  and Caylus, but it felt like Bus to me. Jacob ran away with tundras as I underestimated
  the value of controlling and scoring those each turn. Excited to try this with 3
  or 4 players. London Played this at Mike’s last weekend. Somewhat dry game but there’s
  depth there, though I’ll need a few more plays to rule on this one. I had a hard
  time seeing card combos and strategies emerge - probably not surprising in a first
  learning game but I usually latch on a bit faster to at least a few concepts. Will
  be interesting to see strategies emerge on this one. 1850  I hosted a wonderful
  18xx session two weekends ago, playing 1850 with five players in about six hours.
  Great study in contrasting approaches - Chris S was a great operator and engineer
  (he’s a very skilled and experienced 18xx player) while Mike played the role of
  investor playing a minimal operating role in the game. They both finished within
  spitting distance of each other (a virtual tie given the likely banking errors throughout
  the game) while I pulled up the rear. I missed an opportunity to shift an engine
  and dump a company about 2/3 through the game and had to make some difficult choices
  to keep myself in the game (meaning - I still finished last, but could have ended
  up much worse without some financial engineering). The great thing in my opinion
  about 18xx is that I generally have as much fun losing in 6 hours as I do winning.
  Not as much, but just about as much. 7 Wonders Doug brought over his unplayed copy
  of 7 Wonders last night as I hosted a regular Tuesday night gaming session. This
  game is very easy to learn, plays in about 40 minutes, and looks to be a keeper
  in the mid-filler range. We played twice and in both games scores were close but
  the player collecting the sets of technologies managed to win. We deduced that even
  if you aren’t going after that as a primary strategy, you need to be in the technology
  game or else you’ll cede too many of those cards to your opponents. Mike and I even
  tried to bury several of them in the second game but Doug still managed to win by
  focusing on them. Not sure I need to get this game but I do look forward to playing
  again soon.'
