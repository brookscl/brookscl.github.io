excerpt: 'There''s been quite a bit of talk about the pros and cons of PodCasting. 
  Part of this issue is that people get too wrapped up in the technology as opposed
  to the content.  What does PodCasting have to do with the iPod?  Escapes me... Anyway,
  Aldie and Derk over at BoardGameGeek recently launched an audio series called GeekSpeak. 
  I listened to episodes 1-6 while flying around the country last week, and I was
  very much impressed.  The interviews are well done and both Aldie and Derk are engaging. 
  99% of the population (ok, 99.99%) could care less about this content, which makes
  this model all the more impressive: there''s no other way to broadcast this sort
  of material.  Keep it up guys.'
