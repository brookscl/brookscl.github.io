excerpt: It was my turn to host a Rip City game night.  My travel schedule has forced
  me to bow out of several of the last events and have someone else host in my place,
  so it was nice to finally have things work out.  We had a decent crowd of seven
  tonight. Ken showed up a bit early so he, Matthew, and I tried out a round of Drive,
  the card game from SimplyFun for 2–4 players.  I never seem to get to play a full
  game of this because I’m always on my way to somewhere or something else.  It is
  a fun, easy to learn, light card game that seems to work just as well with 2 or
  3 players.  Haven’t tried it with four yet.  Matthew fed me too many nice cards
  so I managed to win the hand easily.  Ken says he’d rather sit to the left of Matthew
  next game. The rest of the crowd starting arriving promptly at 7pm.  Caylus was the
  universal choice for tonight, so Mike brought along his copy so we could run two
  games concurrently.  We opted to squeeze both games onto our dining room table to
  allow Mike and I to teach it together to everyone.  Well, I taught it verbally while
  Mike mimicked my sample plays and pantomimed some of the verbal commentary.  Quite
  amusing.  I mentioned before that I enjoyed Caylus but had some concerns about a
  runaway leader problem.  I felt much better about this playing, partly because I
  won (!), but mostly because I’m beginning to think the game justly rewards solid
  play.  I was much more prepared in this game and I think my adaptive strategy paid
  off.  Jim struggled with the rules, while George played a solid game and would likely
  give me a much better fight in a second playing. I tried to play contrarian, avoiding
  the castle when I suspected others would go there and getting some early buildings
  out.  Going to the castle when you can build at least two sections seems to be a
  great way to economize on turns (I managed to build three at once in the second
  scoring phase).  I only made one minor planning error in the game – you’ve got to
  pay attention to your resources and plot out your move.  This becomes especially
  important as the number of options grows. We started the instruction around 7:20pm
  and the game at 7:50 or 7:55pm.  We finished about 10:15pm.  I think with experienced
  players, a 3–4 player game should always finish in less than 2 hours.  Both games
  finished within 2 minutes of each other.  Ben apparently pulled out the victory
  in the other game.
