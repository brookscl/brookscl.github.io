<p>We hosted noteworthy gamer <a href="http://opinionatedgamers.com/author/joehuber/">Joe Huber</a> at <a href="http://leadpushers.com/incunabula/">Eric's</a> home this week for a special Thursday night gaming session.  Joe was in town on business and I responded to his plea for Portland gaming.  See, Joe is on a quest to get in 50 plays of <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire">Acquire</a> to celebrate the game's 50th anniversary so I brought my copy over to play.  I hadn't played in years, and Joe informed me that he had probably played more times by the time he was 18 than I've played in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Joe's experience clearly presented itself as he dominated the game, though Eric admirably stayed close.  Dave and I knew early on that we would be competing for third place as we became cash starved and missed out on one acquisition payout after another.  Still a great game that deserved to be played more often.</p>
<p>Next up was a favorite of mine, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2570/atlantic-star">Atlantic Star (aka Show Manager)</a>. This is such a well crafted game in terms of mechanisms -- perfect tension as you see the routes unfold.  I agree with Joe however that casting a show is a much better theme than determine cruise routes.</p>
<p>Finally we played the outstanding card game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9217/saint-petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>.  This is a game I played often when it first came out, including solo plays with the PC game back in 2004.  I hadn't played since 2009 and I can't say why - this is a great 2 or 3 player card game.  A major rookie blunder by me in the final round took me from a solid 2nd place finish to last place, but Joe came out on top again for a game night hat trick.</p>
<p>Joe - thanks for joining us and we look forward to gaming again on your next visit to PDX.</p>
