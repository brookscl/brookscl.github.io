<p>Today I arrive at BGG.CON, the annual BoardGameGeek convention in Dallas. This is my (n-1)th convention, where n is the number of conventions they've held. I missed #2 because I went to Essen that year. </p>
<p>Once again I will be hanging with Jim Ginn who I met at GenCon in Indy (2004 I think) but really got to know (along with lovely wife Jill) at the first BGG.CON when I went as an exhibitor showing off Havoc with KC and Rita. This is the one show I like to make every year as it always comes right at the end of my football coaching season and makes for a great transition to the holiday season when I like to ramp up my gaming activity. Sad thing is I will miss my sons' high school football playoff game on Friday. </p>
<p>This year I hope to play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eclipse</li>
<li>Ora Et Labora</li>
<li>1860</li>
<li>Coreworlds</li>
<li>Lords of Waterdeep</li>
<li>Unhappy King Charles</li>
<li>Antike (with Yehuda in Israel over Skype)</li>
<li>maybe some of the new hot stuff from Essen.</li>
</ul>
<p>But as you can see from the above I don't mind waiting a year. </p>
<p>I also hope to catch up with Texas friends Hamzy (trading local craft beers), Tim, and Jeff (show off the Sony 5-N camera I now own so he can say "told you so").</p>
