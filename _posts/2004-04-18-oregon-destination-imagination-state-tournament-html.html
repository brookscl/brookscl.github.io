excerpt: As I mentioned earlier, Jacob and I spent the weekend in Corvallis at the
  Oregon Destination Imagination state tournament.  This is Jacob's second year in
  the contest.  He is on a team with six of his classmates at Archer Glen elementary
  here in Sherwood. Destination Imagination (or DI, as it is called) is a spinoff
  of Odyssey of the Mind and is a team competition that focuses on creative problem
  solving.  Teams choose one specific challenge from a set offered each year (learn
  more here), and in the competition they perform their solution to that challenge
  and are appraised and ranked against the other teams.  They are also given an Instant
  Challenge, which is a problem they must solve extemporaneously.  Emphasis is on
  creativity, and the kids must do the work themselves.         Nick, Parker, Jacob,
  Hannah, Ellen, and Keatley at Reeser Stadium before their performance. Their team
  (the Katzen Dawgs) one their regional competition and were given an invitation to
  the state championship.  They did extremely well, finishing in fourth place out
  of thirteen teams in their category.         The team during their cartoon challenge.
