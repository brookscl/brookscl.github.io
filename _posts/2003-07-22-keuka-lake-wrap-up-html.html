excerpt: '              We had a great but too-short time at Keuka Lake this year. 
  I managed to stay         there for 9 days while Julie, Jacob, and Matthew were
  there for about 2.5 weeks (they         normally spend 4-6 weeks there). It was
  a fun-filled, busy week and a time for both         sides of our family to enjoy
  the lake and surrounding areas.  My sister Jennifer         and her family (husband
  James and 5 kids!) joined us for a week, and Julie''s brother         Mike is there
  for the entire summer learning the ropes of cottage, boat, and lake         management.                                                                                                            Speaking
  of Mike, he recently earned his pilot''s license and took Jacob, Matthew,                     and
  I flying around the finger lakes for about 90 minutes.  It was a fantastic                     trip
  - we over-flew the cottages and the length of Keuka Lake, headed over to Seneca                     lake,
  passed by Watkins Glen and the racetrack there, then returned via Corning and                     Canisteo. 
  I didn''t get any solid pictures on my digital camera but I got a few                     great
  shots with Julie''s Canon Eos body and telephoto lens.  That''s Mike on the                     left
  flying the plane (a Cessna 172 4-seater).  The only downside was that Jacob                     got
  a bit motion sick.                                                                                                                        As
  usual Jacob and Matthew spent the bulk of their time in the water.  Jacob                     is
  now a comfortable water-skier (2 skis for now) and even managed to get up on the                     wakeboard
  once.  Matthew prefers tubing and he was a madman this year, including                     several
  rounds of "battle tubing" where we towed two tubes and did some stunts and                     wrestling
  between the two.                            '
