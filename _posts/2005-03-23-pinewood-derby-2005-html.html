excerpt: I'm the Cubmaster for Cub Scout Pack 710 - been doing it for 2 years now
  and will likely do it for one more until Jacob moves on to Boy Scouts.  My favorite
  event each year is the pinewood derby. This year we held a workshop at Sherwood
  High School, hosted by the most excellent technical education teacher John Neibergall. 
  The high school has an outstanding shop for woodworking, metal work, and computer-aided
  design.  John is very involved with scouts in the area and had some Boy Scouts from
  a local troop there to help coach the Cubs.         John makes some cuts for Nick,
  Jacob, and Matthew at the wood shop. One of my goals in running the derby is to
  keep it somewhat competitive but to allow the kids to race as much as possible. 
  We impound the cars after final weigh-in and assign each car a unique number.  I
  use the outstanding spreadsheet from Chris Sutton to divide the kids into groups
  and automatically generate heats.  This allows each car to race 5 or 6 times across
  different lanes to help neutralize any lane advantages.         The freshly painted
  track setup in front of the PA and projection system. I project the spreadsheet
  for all to see and we keep the action going non-stop.  One challenge in previous
  years was judging placement in each race.  I would assign four adults to watch the
  finish line, each one assigned to a lane.  This was problematic at times, especially
  when we had photo finishes.  This year we decided to purchase a Microwizard K2 LED
  timer and it worked like a charm.  It has a tolerance down to 1/1000 of a second
  and we still had a tie during one of our races.         Our shiny new timer.
