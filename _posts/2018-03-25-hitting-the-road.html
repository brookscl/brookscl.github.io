<p>Julie and I are off on our next big adventure. I’m hanging out in a McDonald’s in Grants Pass, Oregon while Julie visits and plays games with an old friend. Tonight we’ll be in Lakeview, OR and the next day we’ll head towards Salt Lake City, stopping for some hiking in northern Nevada.</p>
<p>Our plan is to spend about 3 weeks (or so) in southern Utah, exploring the many national parks and monuments there. We will mostly car camp but plan to do at least two backpacking trips. The Subaru is fully loaded and we are excited for what awaits us. We'll work our way back through California and wind up back home around May 1.</p>
<p>I’ll be posting single images as we explore and have connectivity.</p>
