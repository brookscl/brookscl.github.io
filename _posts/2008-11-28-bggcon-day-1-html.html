excerpt: 'Thanksgiving weekend gives me a chance to catch up on my BGG.CON posts.
  As much as I''d like to crank these out while at the convention, gaming takes precedence.
  There are many more photos that aren''t shown here over on my Flickr photostream.
  N.B. - Don''t expect much detailed commentary on games here - I''ll provide a wrap-up
  at the end and talk more about hits and misses.  Jim Ginn and I synchronized our
  arrivals at DFW and made it to the Westin by 3pm. Eager to help, we joined the crew
  stapling instructions to the plastic sleeves holding the new BGG Coins. I''ve yet
  to hand mine off, but I did track its journey to the beach this weekend.  Next up
  was the assembly line to build out the goody bags for attendees. The swag - not
  so hot this year but the prize table more than made up for it.  Derk and Aldie were
  especially calm before the event. You get the sense they have a great team behind
  them and that all of the important details had been worked out. I also saw them
  both gaming and teaching quite a bit.  Jim and Mark Hamzy were up for trying out
  the new Martin Wallace title After the Flood. This is a three-player war and economics
  game that is by far the deepest so far of the Treefrog Line.  I think Hamzy won
  this one - a bit tough to learn from the rules (complexity is similar to Brass)
  but we worked our way through it and had a lot of fun to boot. Highlight: Hamzy
  and I slugging it out trying to get a majority of workers in a province to start
  an empire. Neither of us would back down and I think we ended up with a combined
  13 workers.  Jeff arrived later that evening and had his copy of Race for the Galaxy
  handy. Morgan joined us and he and Jeff schooled us but the game was fun as always.  Our
  other new game of the night was Cities, a light game of tile laying and meeple placement.
  This is a competitive solitaire game that has a puzzle aspect to it like Take it
  Easy. Very fun game that I''ll happily play but I''m not sure it has a place in
  my collection. '
