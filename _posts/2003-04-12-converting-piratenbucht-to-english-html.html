excerpt: "              I recently purchased the German-language Piratenbucht online
  \        from Funagain.  This is a very attractive         game, with a nice large
  board, good quality cardboard and wooden bits, but with German-language         cards. 
  Since I don't yet read or speak German (though I'm trying to learn),         I needed
  to make English-language versions of the cards.                   Spielfrieks to
  the rescue: Mark Blanco was kind enough to make up standard card-size         English
  versions of the cards and he posted         them to the geek.  I picked up some
  full-page         Avery labels for inkjet printers and printed out the cards.  I
  then mounted         them to extra Magic: the Gathering common cards (green ones,
  if you care) and the         results look great.      "

<p>I recently purchased the German-language<br />
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=2987">Piratenbucht</a> online<br />
from <a href="http://www.funagain.com">Funagain</a>. This is a very attractive game, with<br />
a nice large board, good quality cardboard and wooden bits, but with German-<br />
language cards. Since I don't yet read or speak German (though I'm trying to<br />
learn), I needed to make English-language versions of the cards.</p>
<p>Spielfrieks to the rescue: Mark Blanco was kind enough to make up standard<br />
card-size English versions of the cards and he <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewfile.php3?fileid=2825">posted them to the<br />
geek</a>. I picked up<br />
some <a href="http://www.avery.com/product<br />
s/add_to_cart.jsp?upc=7278208165&amp;catalog_code=WEB01">full-page Avery labels for inkjet printers</a> and printed out the<br />
cards. I then mounted them to extra Magic: the Gathering common cards (green<br />
ones, if you care) and the results look great.</p>
