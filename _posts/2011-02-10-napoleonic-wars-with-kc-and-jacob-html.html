<p>On Saturday KC, Jacob and I played the classic card-driven game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36399/the-napoleonic-wars-2nd-edition">Napoleonic Wars</a>.  KC was interested in something longer and deeper and when he opened the door to maybe playing a multi-player wargame I had to jump at the chance.</p>

<p>KC played the Brits, Jacob the Russians / Austrians, and I was the French.  This was my third play of the game.  The first time was a <a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2008/8/13/session-report-napoleonic-wars.html">two player game vs Jacob</a> where he played the French and won after I gambled on peace after the first turn.  The second time was at <a href="http://dugsreports.blogspot.com/2008/08/wbc-west-report-6-friday-evening-thru.html">Doug's WBC-West</a> where I played the Brits (again) but had a three turn game.</p>

<p>It was slow crawling at first as I taught KC and we all got (re-)acquainted with the system.  I had a robust march into eastern Europe and the Adriatic with Napoleon, but Jacob made the right moves and got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kutuzov">Kutuzov</a> there quickly to provide the necessary support to Austrians before I could quickly wipe them off the map.  Still, I was ahead by several points at the end of the turn, and give up a card to swing the peace roll in my favor.  This forced Jacob and KC to play a bit of chicken with each other and they ended up chancing it on a D6, and once again the French prevailed with a 6 roll.  This was just fine by all of us as Jacob had to <a href="http://vimeo.com/19642907">work on his health project video</a> which allowed KC and I to dive into A Game of Thrones LCG.</p>
