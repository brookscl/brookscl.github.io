excerpt: I'm trying out the new Zoch zum Spielen game Salamanca. This is a tile laying
  game that feels a bit like New England to me. Players take control of buildings
  attached to various landscapes that can produce points. Tiles are placed in an 8x8
  grid and the producing tiles grow out orthogonally from buildings. The goal is to
  end rounds with a 7 point or higher farm under your control, which scores 2 gold.
  You also have opportunities to sell your farm, allowing you to move your worker
  (control marker) to another building. There are some turn-order building cards that
  give some special abilities like plagues and building destroyers.    If it sounds
  pretty dry, it is. Nothing really grabbed me about the game and I think I'll pass.
  Very much a thinking game and it might be a good fit for some folks - just not for
  me.
