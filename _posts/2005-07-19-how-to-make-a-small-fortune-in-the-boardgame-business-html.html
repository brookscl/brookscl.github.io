excerpt: 'Have you ever heard this quotation?  How do you make a small fortune in
  the boardgame business?  Start with a large one. This quotation often gets attributed
  to Reiner Knizia, but it is a general statement for just about any hobby/lifestyle
  business that involves capital investment.  Here are some other examples:   Motor
  Sports  Winemaking  Bass Fishing  The Internet  Airline Consulting  eCommerce  Commodities
  Trading  Gambling  Model Rocketry The funny thing is that in just about each of
  these industries, someone attributes the origin of the quotation to a specific individual
  in that business.  Clearly this saying originated from some context... wonder where?'
