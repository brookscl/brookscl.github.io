<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died">Douglas Preston</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Any Cretaceous mammal burrow is incredibly rare,” he said. “But this one is impossible—it’s dug right through the KT boundary.” Perhaps, he said, the mammal survived the impact and the flood, burrowed into the mud to escape the freezing darkness, then died. “It may have been born in the Cretaceous and died in the Paleocene,” he said. “And to think—sixty-­six million years later, a stinky monkey is digging it up, trying to figure out what happened.” He added, “If it’s a new species, I’ll name it after you.”</p>

<p>Crazy fun read about what might be the most important paleontology find of our generation.</p>
