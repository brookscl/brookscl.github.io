excerpt: 'Day 2 of our Bulge tour was geared more to accommodating our tourists stops,
  so there was not much rhyme or reason to the sites we visited. We ranged from Hotton
  to Diekirch (Luxembourg) to Bastogne.  After visiting the caves near Hotton, we
  stopped by the Hotton War Cemetery, which commemorates over 600 casualties from
  the Commonwealth countries. The scene was all the more striking with the 2 inches
  of fresh snow that had fallen in the past hour. Hotton marked the limit of General
  Manteuffel''s advance:    The commander of the 116th Panzer Division, as well as
  General Manteuffel, would later pay tribute to "the bravery of the American engineers"
  at Hotton. They had reason for this acknowledgment (in which they could have included
  signal and service troops, unknown gun and tank crews) because the failure to secure
  the Hotton bridge was decisive in the future history of the LVIII Panzer Corps.
  Credit must also go to the Combat Command Reserve at Soy whose fire, as the enemy
  acknowledged, caught Kampfgruppe Bayer in the flank and checkmated its single-minded
  employment against Hotton. Finally, a share in the successful defense of the Hotton
  bridge should be assigned those elements of the three 3d Armored task forces which,
  on the 21st, had engaged the bulk of the 116th Panzer Division and 560th Volks Grenadier
  Division and prevented a wholesale advance into the Hotton sector.     Source: Wikisource,
  The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter XVI   Next it was time to leave Belgium
  and explore the northeast portion of Luxembourg. While there are Bulge museums in
  many of the towns in Belgium and Luxembourg, my research indicated that the National
  Museum of Military History at Diekirch is one of the best (also check out their
  suggested Bulge tours - some great trips if you want to focus on the southern shoulder).  The
  museum is deceptively large - when we first arrived we were a bit disappointed as
  we saw the first room, which appeared to be a somewhat random collection of military
  equipment tightly packed into a large hanger-style room. To our surprise, the museum
  went on and on with an amazing array of diorama-style displays and probably the
  best collection of equipment and armament from WWII that I''ve ever seen. The boys
  had fun pointing out the various weapons they''ve had the pleasure of firing in
  Call of Duty. My great uncle Charlie served in the 17th Airborne in the Bulge (he
  was a Lt) and was shot in the foot during the push-back from the north in January.
  He served under the controversial Montgomery for the bulk of his time in the Bulge.  We
  made a brief stop in Clervaux and found a marker for the Liberty Road, marking the
  allied trail of liberation from France through Belgium and Luxembourg.  We also
  made the obligatory stop at the tank and artillery static display near Clervaux.  We
  ended the day in Bastogne, perhaps the most notable and recognizable town from the
  battle. Bastogne was a key objective for the German advance because of its strategic
  location at the convergence of seven key roads. By December 20, 1944 the town was
  surrounded by German forces with elements of the 101st Airborne Division digging
  in to defend what would become known as the Siege of Bastogne. North of town is
  the impressive Mardasson Memorial, a dramatic tribute to the USA from Belgium.  The
  top of the memorial offers dramatic views of the Bastogne landscape to the south,
  with annotated maps showing key actions and events during the battle.  This portion
  of the memorial best describes the Belgian view of the significance of the battle
  and liberation of their country.   Travel'
