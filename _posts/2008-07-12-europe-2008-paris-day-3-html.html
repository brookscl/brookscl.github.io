excerpt: 'Day 3 in France started with an early morning trip to Île de la Cité for
  a visit to Notre Dame de Paris, famous for gargoyles, gypsies, and hunchbacks. We
  saw at least 2 of the 3.  We roamed the island for a while, visiting Ponte Neuf
  and the Mémorial des Martyrs de la Déportation before crossing to visit the Rive
  Gauche.  While most of the stalls along the river were close, Shakespeare and Company
  was not so we spent 20 minutes or so browsing the English book selection.  Our big
  museum visit of the day was the Louvre, and we devised a plan to keep the boys engaged
  that worked perfectly. We allowed them to roam on their own but gave them a checklist
  of exhibits to see. They had fun and we were able to browse at our own leisurely
  pace. The highlight for me was the Coronation of Napoleon.  We opted to eat in our
  hotel room that night, icing / chilling our beer (from Orval) and champagne (from
  Taittinger) to go with... what else but Pizza Hut?  Julie and Lisa surprised us
  with a collection of dessert pastries - very tasty. Also, if you happen to get a
  pizza in Paris from Pizza Hut, make sure you get it with "cheesy fun crust" - there''s
  nothing like it in the US and we still talk about it today. '
