<p>Julie can bear witness to my gradually escalating frustration with my desktop photo and video editing platform I use at home.  I abandoned doing any movie production in iMovie on that machine earlier this year, and my <a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2011/3/29/galapagos-photo-processing.html">Lightroom workflow</a> has been significantly hindered.</p>
<p>I've suspected for a while that the key issue is my storage solution - a Drobo drive array with about 2.7TB of storage attached to my iMac via Firewire 800. Julie and I agreed (well, her words were more likely "OK, whatever") that it was time for an upgrade. Last week I took delivery of a custom Mac Mini with a new external drive empowered by the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface">Intel and Apple developed Thunderbolt</a>) technology.</p>
<p>Specifically, here's what I ordered:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.7GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7</li>
<li>8GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM- 2x4GB</li>
<li>256GB Solid State Drive</li>
<li><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/H7114ZM/A/lacie-little-big-disk-thunderbolt-series-hard-drive">LaCie 2TB Little Big Disk RAID 0 Thunderbolt drive</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wanting some empirical support for this upgrade, I decided to benchmark the various disk interface options (old and new) to see how things compare. I used the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550">Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</a> tool installed from the Mac app store.  There may be better tools out there but this was free, easy to use, and seem to produce reliable and repeatable results.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the Drobo was the real performance dog in this show - a faster computer obviously wasn't going to make any difference.  In fact, when accessing the Drobo from my Mac Mini via USB performance went down about 30% vs accessing it from my iMac via Firewire.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the internal Apple supplied solid state drives (SSDs) performed extremely well on both my MacBook Pro and Mac Mini.  I suspect they are identical 250GB drives in both machines.</p>
<p>What blew me away was the Thunderbolt 2TB external drive performance.  My take is that we are seeing an unconstrained I/O channel (Thunderbolt) combined with the advantage of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_0#RAID_0">RAID 0 striped drive</a>.  Given that I went with the 5400 RPM drives vs 7200 I didn't expect the performance to <strong>surpass</strong> my SSDs, but that's what I'm seeing.  Write performance is over <em>30% faster on the Thunderbolt drive</em> vs the SSD.</p>
<p>And yes, my subjective take on the performance improvement in Lightroom and iMovie is "wow, what a difference".  And Julie doesn't have to put up with my complaining anymore.</p>
