excerpt: My ISP crashed the box where my weblog was hosted.  I may have lost quite
  a bit of content as well.  My own fault for not having a better backup strategy.
  I'll be gradually replacing content as I recover it from various sources, so please
  be patient.  If you happen to use a news aggregator and have an archive of my postings,
  please let me know!  You might be able to help me out.
