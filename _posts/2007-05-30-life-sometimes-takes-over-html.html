excerpt: 'I can''t let May go by with only one post, so here''s a quick rundown of
  what''s been going on:  CheckFree''s acquisition of Corillian closed in the middle
  of the month.  Exciting times!  I attended RailsConf 2007.  Learned a little, experienced
  a lot.  I plan to do a post on what it''s like to be an outsider at that show.   We
  spent Memorial Day in Bend and Sunriver, OR doing our annual trek for baseball tournaments. 
  Tons of photos were taken - enjoy. I have not played a board or card game since
  the session on May 1.  Hopefully I''ll break out of that drought as we take the
  train to Seattle this coming weekend to see the Mariners play on Saturday night.
  Max Michael of Stratamax Games will spend 3 days with us in July as he takes his
  first trip to the sunny Pacific NW.  We''ll spend most of the time out on the coast.
  A bought a MacBook Pro, and I love it so far.  Jacob and I are excited to start
  recording some guitar tracks in Garage Band.'
