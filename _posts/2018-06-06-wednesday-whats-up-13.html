<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/military-rank-and-insignia/">A Primer on Military Rank and Insignia</a> – As an Air Force guy, I still find myself making mistakes as I see (mainly enlisted) Army folks while strolling around West Point. This article helped.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.insidegmt.com/?p=20261">GMT Website Update</a> – My favorite game publisher is in the middle of significant back-office and website changes, hopefully for the better.</li>
<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/05/10_strikes_and_youre_out">10 Strikes and You’re Out – the iOS Feature You’re Probably Not Using But Should</a> – Good reminder. I’m using this feature (now).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m in the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger%27s_Apprentice">Ranger’s Apprentice</a> series, having finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2408018801?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">The Ruins of Gorlan</a> in less than a week. That’s fast for me. This is young adult fantasy but perfect for summer reading.</li>
<li>Julie and I listened to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2397369272">Talking God</a>, part of a series of books by Tony Hillerman about a pair of native American lawmen. OK but not great, I still want to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425098.A_Thief_of_Time">A Thief of Time</a> which is tied closer to some of the ruins and sites we saw in southern Utah last month.</li>
<li>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2219635362">The Power of Zero: How to Get to the 0% Tax Bracket and Transform Your Retirement</a> over-promises a bit though I learned some tips. If nothing else it encouraged me to dig deeper into the specifics of required minimum distributions from qualified accounts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2335613652">Manage Your Day-To-Day: Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind</a> was better than I expected. It is a marketing piece and a conglomeration of what read like blog articles, but good value of some great writers involved.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>I found <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/29264777">Exploding Kittens</a> in a Target on our way to West Point and picked it up. Julie and I played a couple of times with Matthew over beers and enjoyed it. Very light game and will be even better with a larger group.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Julie and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/29351769">Lanterns: The Harvest Festival</a> while enjoying a beer last week at <a href="http://www.steubenbrewingcompany.com">Steuben Brewing</a> just up the hill from us. <strong>Big</strong> fan of this for two or three players.</li>
<li>Julie and I played our staple <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/29367638">Five Crowns</a> last weekend. Julie won and is creeping back towards a 50/50 split lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/05/31/615247730/first-listen-sugarland-bigger">First Listen: Sugarland, ‘Bigger’</a> – Pretty country.</li>
<li>Spotify – What? I shut Spotify down about a year ago and switched to Amazon Music, mainly to see how it is and if the Echo integration was significantly better. Echo: better. Music: not better. I miss the social sharing, release radar, discover weekly, etc. Found a deal for returning members ($9.99 for 3 months) so I’m back in and shut down Amazon Music.</li>
</ul>
