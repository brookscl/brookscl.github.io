excerpt: I'll be at the Essen Spiel show again this year and while I don't expect
  to be online with the laptop much (if at all - it is expensive!) I'd like to be
  able to easily mail in posts from my BlackBerry. So consider this a first test.   I've
  got a bunch of stuff to talk about regarding Essen, Sunriver Games, and gaming in
  general so expect to see a lot of posting over the next 2 weeks.
