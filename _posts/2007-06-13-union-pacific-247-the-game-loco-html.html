excerpt: 'Gaming sessions have been few and far between over the past 2 months.  I
  looked at my game journal and noticed an entry on May 1 (my session at Mike''s)
  and one play of Battleground: Fantasy Warfare with Jacob on May 15.  Needless to
  say I was excited to host a few friends for gaming last night. We had a special
  guest: Peter Drake from Lewis and Clark College.  Peter is a professor of computer
  science there and will be using 24/7: the Game as a game to implement for a spring
  CS course next year.  He is using agile development techniques (eXtreme Programming
  I believe) and wants to have periodic visits from a real onsite customer, so he
  reached out to Sunriver Games.  Last night was a chance for him to meet the designer,
  get a copy of the game, and join us for some gaming. I invested no time ahead of
  the session learning anything new (I''m itching to play Winds of Plunder) so I suggested
  the classic Union Pacific.  Most of us have played the game many times, but we still
  managed to screw up the rules.  We forgot to have each player secretly lay down
  a company share at the start of the game.  When the first scoring round came up,
  nobody had any shares out so nobody scored.  Probably not a big deal.  I always
  enjoy this game, but lately I wonder if I should just be playing Ticket to Ride
  (or one of the expansions) instead.  There''s less tension in UP than TtR I think,
  and it can become all too clear who is going to win as you hit the second to last
  scoring round. Peter wanted to learn how to play 24/7 so Carey taught the game and
  we played a four-player partnership game.  Dave and I absolutely crushed Carey and
  Peter, nearly doubling their score.  There''s a decent amount of luck-of-the-draw
  in the game but I always enjoy it.  We had some nice discussions about how to best
  implement an artificial intelligence (AI) for the game, something Peter will likely
  include in his class.  We completed the evening with a game of Loco!, the Knizia
  card game.  I played this once before and enjoyed it then, but playing it a second
  time makes me realize just how chaotic the game is.  We all struggled with choices
  on what cards to play - either we just don''t get the game, or there really aren''t
  good approaches to the game with four players.  I think I would have enjoyed a game
  of Tichu or Die Sieben Siegal more.'
