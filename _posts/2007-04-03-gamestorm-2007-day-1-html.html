excerpt: '(You can see all of my GameStorm photos on my Flickr photoset.) I''m coming
  back to this blogging thing with a flurry.  I expect to make no fewer than 5 posts
  over the next week, so strap on your seatbelts, I''m back! I spent a lot of time
  preparing for this GameStorm - I ran the Kniziathon and co-ran the two player tournament. 
  I''ll talk more about the Kniziathon in a separate post and stick to the other stuff
  that happened on day 1 of the convention.  I consider day 1 to be Friday (making
  Thursday day 0 of course, because there were a few events that happened Thursday
  night).  The GameStorm staff selected the Sheraton PDX Airport hotel for the convention
  this year, by far the best venue they''ve had and I made it clear to the organizers
  (Aaron, Aaron, and Beverly) that a return to the same hotel next year would be most
  appreciated, even at a price premium.  Jacob and I shared a two-queen room with
  Ken and Brandon for $100/night, and this is one of the recently upgraded Sheratons
  with improved beds and showers.  Plenty of space and comfortable accomodations combined
  with nice gaming digs made me a happy gamer.  Jacob and I arrived about 8:15am on
  Friday to set up the Kniziathon HQ booth.  Most of the daytime hours were spent
  playing various pickup Knizia games, plus a scheduled session of Amun Re that I
  ran for 8 people from noon to 2pm.  Even with a new player we played the game in
  about 90 minutes.  This game is definitely in my top 2 or 3 games list and packs
  a lot of punch for its short playing time.  I also played Ra, Through the Desert,
  Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation, and Pickomino during the day.  After a quick
  trip to Subway for dinner with a small group, KC and I kicked off the annual Friday
  night 2-player tournament.  Last year we had a dismal turnout - only about 6 people
  participating.  This year we made it part of the Kniziathon and made it an all-Knizia
  affair and ended up having 20 gamers participate.  We ran the tournament for three
  rounds, Swiss-style, in three hours.  The first round we played Lost Cities, then
  did a player''s choice for subsequent rounds with the "white" (vs. black in chess
  terms) player choosing the game.  We saw Battle Line, Carcassonne: the Castle, Through
  the Desert, Ingenious, and Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation played multiple
  times.  After three rounds Chris Ballowe and Jeff Ganong were tied with three points
  each.  They agreed to a fourth playoff round, with Chris coming out on top after
  a game of Battle Line.  Starting around 10pm, I spent the next 3-4 hours tabulating
  interim results for the Kniziathon.  More on that later.'
