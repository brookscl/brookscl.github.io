excerpt: 'Today was the regional Chess for Success scholastic tournament, and I coached
  10 boys from Archer Glen to compete for the right to compete in the state tournament
  in March.  There were 11 teams competing and we needed to finish 1st or 2nd to advance. 
  I knew we had a strong team, but I had no expectations of advancing and just wanted
  the boys to have fun and try their hardest. They did amazingly well!  This is a
  team competition in five rounds, swiss-style.  Of the 10 players we send to the
  tournament, we count the scores for the top four players on the team.  Players get
  1 point for a win, 1/2 point for a draw, and 0 for a loss.  So the maximum team
  score over five rounds is 20 points.        The Archer Glen Chess Team.  Back row:
  Coach, Conner Hendryx, Spencer LaFarge, Jackson Wright, Ryan Foley, Justin Davis. 
  Front row: Nick Rowlands, Collin Christensen, Jordan Morales, Jacob Brooks, Matthew
  Brooks. Our team got off to a great start with a perfect score of 8 after the first
  two rounds.  Things got tough then, with a couple of our heavy hitters taking losses
  in the third round, where we score 2.5 points.  By the time the final round came
  up, we were tied for second place with 12 points, with two other teams knocking
  on the door with 11.5.  We needed some key final round victories to secure a second
  place finish and a trip to the state championship.        Jacob concentrates on
  his final game, a critical victory that helped secure second place for the team.
  Our hero of the day, Justin Davis, carried us with a perfect 5-0 record, winning
  the individual championship.  Jacob and Conner Hendryx had critical final round
  victories to give the team a final score of 14.5, tying them for second place and
  a trip to the state championship!  Jacob finished the day with 3 points, making
  him one of the top 4 players on the Archer Glen team.        Matthew and Jordan
  focus on their games. Matthew had a great day as well - he held the team''s 10th
  position, and was the only first grader playing in the tournament.  He finished
  the day with 2 points and felt great about his achievements.        One highlight
  was a team chess game on the giant chessboard.'
