<p>I promised to post some highlights from our second game against St Helens. We had some great things happen, but if you watch closely you'll see how a great running back can overcome some mistakes made on the line.</p>

<p>For a play that will blow your mind, skip to the 2:12 spot in the video. Where's the ball?</p>
