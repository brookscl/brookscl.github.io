excerpt: 'Patrick Korner does a nice job interviewing Martin Wallace of Age of Steam
  fame (and others).Â  My favorite quote:  Martin Wallace: This is by design. Warfrog
  cannot compete with the big German companies for the lighter end of the market -
  tried and failed with Stockers to do that. However, the big German companies cannot
  afford to do the heavier games, their overheads are far too high. The odd heavier
  games that do get released by German companies are almost vanity projects - they
  know they won''t make much money but they help to maintain a reputation among the
  spielfrieks. I make a little money from Warfrog but there is much more to be made
  designing lighter games for the German companies. '
