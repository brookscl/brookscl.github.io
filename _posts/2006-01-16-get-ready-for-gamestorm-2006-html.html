excerpt: " When it comes to gaming conventions in Portland, there’s really only one
  game in town and that’s GameStorm.  We’ll be running a number of events this year,
  including a 2–player tournament, a Havoc tournament, our traditional Sunday morning
  family gaming session, and a Sunriver Games prototype session.  Mark your calendar:
  March 24–26 at the Red Lion at the Quay in Vancouver, WA. They are also holding
  a free game day this Saturday in Portland.  KC and I plan to be there to try out
  a prototype or two."
