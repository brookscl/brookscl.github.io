<p>Last week I returned from another stellar <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/bggcon">BGG.CON gaming convention</a>.  The routine has become very attractive and fulfilling for me: play games, drink beer and eat some food at the hotel bar, go for a run, repeat.  It is just the break I need after a hectic football season.  My gaming trickles to nearly zero from August to October - check out this graph of games played by month from 2008-2011.</p>

<p>November certainly peaks every year, largely because of BGG.CON but also because I get back to hosting gaming, gaming with my local group, and gaming over the Thanksgiving holiday.  December looks a bit lower than expected, but I suspect I'll get in 25-30 new game plays this coming month.</p>
<p>Great job Derk, Aldie, and the rest of the BGG.CON for putting on another great show.  We are moving to a new venue next year so it will mix things up a bit, but I'm sure they will maintain high standards for the event.</p>
<p>Let's break down what I played this year.</p>
<h3>Great Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2612/18al">18AL</a> -- 18xx is a tradition now at BGG.CON and we (Mark, Jim, and I) played the pimped-out version of 18AL.  I had a hard time of it, nearly going bankrupt but rising from the ashes to throw off a <strong>lot</strong> of cash, helping push Hamzy over the edge and get a narrow victory over Jim.  18AL is losing a bit of its luster for me but the company was great.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a> -- Agricola remains my #1 favorite best-ever game and it was great to get in a live version of this with Yehuda and Nadine (from Israel) (and Jim of course).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65825/gettysburg">Gettysburg</a> -- Unfortunately Jim and I didn't get to finish our game -- my second false start of this wonderful game without a finish.  Improves on the mechanics introduced in <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36887/waterloo">Waterloo</a> but I like the setting and streamlined nature of Gettysburg.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39953/a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game">A Game of Thrones: the Card Game</a> -- Up there with Magic: the Gathering as one of my two all-time favorite collectible / trading card games.  Wiped out Jim's Targaryen deck with my awesome Martell deck.  Oh, I built Jim's deck as well but just set him up.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91872/dungeons-dragons-the-legend-of-drizzt-board-game">D&amp;D: The Legend of Drizzt Board Game</a> -- I love the D&amp;D boardgame series and it was even more fun with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzt_Do'Urden">characters I enjoyed in Salvatore's books</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation">Innovation</a> -- one of my favorites of the show, and I've played it twice since and still love it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OK Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/48726/alien-frontiers">Alien Frontiers</a> -- This was the first game I played on Thursday and while I enjoyed it I don't think this brings enough new to the table to encourage repeat playing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105624/poseidons-kingdom">Poseidon's Kingdom</a> -- Lovely to look at and surprisingly quick to play once we got going, but not much game there and a bit clunky rules-wise.  Had fun and enjoyed teaching it to another group though, but not worth spending $100 to own.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/69789/ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer">Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer</a> -- I only know this game well because of the iPad version.  Decent deck-building fun but best suited for electronic play vs AI (fast!).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34585/keltis">Keltis</a> -- My second or third play of this game and it remains enjoyable.  It feels <em>so</em> tense when playing - I suspect everyone feels like they aren't making progress because the cards just won't go your way.  Plays in only about 40 minutes and I'd gladly play again.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59294/runewars">Rune Wars</a> -- I'm on the fence about this one and hope to play again in December.  I really enjoyed the play but it left me feeling like it is very much like other multi-player build-an-army-and-conquer games.  Then again, I there is probably more subtlety to the game that I'm missing (recruiting neutrals as allies seems like a good plan, maybe I should have focused on questing more, etc.) so I will reserve judgment until another play.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19764/punct">PÃœNCT</a> -- Love the GIPF series of games and need to remember to pull out my copies at home more often.  Julie enjoys two-player abstracts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I'll Pass</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108044/nefarious">Nefarious</a> -- My rating here is partly informed by the hefty $60 price tag for a light-ish card game, and partly because the game left me wanting more depth.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/73439/troyes">Troyes</a> -- Glad I got to play this hit from last year.  There's so much to like about this game, but I really hated people stealing my dice.  Money seemed to flow too freely that I wonder if we played something wrong.  Get your hands off my dice!</li>
</ul>
