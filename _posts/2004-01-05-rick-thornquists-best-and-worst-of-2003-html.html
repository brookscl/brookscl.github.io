excerpt: Another good list reflecting on 2003, this time from Rick Thornquist of “gone
  cardboard” and “gamewire” fame.  I agree with his list, though there were several
  that I didn't play (Mammoth Hunters, Yellowstone Park, Fish Eat Fish).  Fortunately,
  the ones I didn't play were generally on his “worst of” list.
