excerpt: I took advantage of some solo time at home last week to invite some friends
  over for gaming.  It was my turn to host our weekly Tuesday night gaming, but I
  managed to sneak Doug over earlier in the afternoon to play several turns of Paths
  of Glory (Dug's report). I can't remember when I picked up PoG, though I'm certain
  it was an eBay used purchase.  I love the idea of card driven games (CDG) and knew
  this was considered one of the best (the others, Hannibal and We the People, being
  quite a bit harder to come by).  The theme of WWI was also attractive.  Doug always
  does a masterful job of teaching - we had a very similar experience with Europe
  Engulfed - but unfortunately we (I) don't seem to have the time to play through
  an entire game like this.  I had no problems understanding the game and was even
  getting a sense (I think) of some basic strategies for the allies.  Still, it was
  easy to conclude after we finished about 3 hours of gaming and finishing only 3
  turns that this game needs to go on my sell/trade pile.  There simply isn't room
  in my collection for 2 player games that take 6-8 hours, and given a choice of keeping
  one or two I will keep Europe Engulfed over Paths of Glory.  For now Twilight Struggle
  is filling the CDG spot in my collection but I would certainly welcome suggestions
  for a 2-3 hours CDG that Jacob might enjoye playing with me.  Doug did convince
  me that Combat Commander would likely be a great choice for Jacob and me. Tuesday
  night I convinced the group to play TurfMaster Deluxe, a game I purchased in Essen
  but hadn't come out yet.  I found it easy to teach, engaging, and fun - I think
  the group mostly did too, though a few seemed ambivalent about the game.  We had
  a very exciting finish with four players finishing within 10 points of the leader.  My
  final game played before heading to the coast for New Years gaming was 1850 with
  Mike (Mike's report), Tim, KC, and Eric.  After playing 18FL I knew I wanted to
  own one of the newer Deep Thought games, and 1850 was my choice given where I grew
  up ("I've lived on 6 of these hexes!").  1850 did not disappoint - it is quite a
  bit longer than 18FL, but I never felt bored and the time flew (we played in about
  6 hours).  Clearly not a game that will come out every month, but I hope to play
  4 18XX games in 2007 and I'd like this to be one of them.  My next post will be
  about gaming over New Years weekend and my success (or not?) in finishing the year
  without any unplayed games.
