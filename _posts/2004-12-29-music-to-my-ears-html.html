excerpt: 'A while back I talked about some of my musical interests.  This post prompted
  some helpful comments that pointed me to some other artists.  Here are some thoughts
  on stuff I''ve been listening to lately.  Jeff - thanks for the pointer to Josh
  Rouse''s 1972.  I love this album - right up my alley.  The retro sound makes it
  such a period piece - perfect when mixed in with some Neil Young and Carole King
  from 1972. Mike - thanks for the pointer to Iron & Wine.  Great stuff.  Not as wild
  about Neko Case, but she''s growing on me. After reading Wilco: Learning How to
  Die I was compelled to revisit all of Wilco''s catalog plus Uncle Tupelo and Son
  Volt.  Wilco gets better and better with age- I would say they are underrated but
  I think most people rate them pretty highly.  At least those that know who they
  are; all 300,000 of us or so.  I also picked up the Mermaid Avenue collaborations
  with Billy Bragg - their take on a collection of Woodie Guthrie''s unrecorded lyrics. 
  I also watched I Am Trying to Break Your Heart for the second time while waiting
  in the Miami airport to return after the cruise. Brian Wilson''s Smile.  I feel
  like I stepped into a time machine - it is amazing being able to pick this CD up
  and listen to it for the first time.  Was this what it was like hearing Pet Sounds
  after its original release? Neil Young''s Tonight''s the Night. Bruce Springsteen''s
  Nebraska. Bob Dylan''s Blonde on Blonde.'
