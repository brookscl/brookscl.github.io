<p>I decided I need a title for when I post it not on Wednesday as planned but on Thursday. Sorry.</p>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2hNWT0c">Smart Baseball: The Story Behind the Old Stats That Are Ruining the Game, the New Ones That Are Running It, and the Right Way to Think About Baseball</a> – Excellent book debunking the old stats we grew up with and making the case for different analysis tools to evaluate offense, pitching, and defense.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimwatching">What I’m Watching</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5071412/">Ozark</a> – This is so much fun. Breaking Bad with Jason Bateman.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6958022/">The Defiant Ones</a> – Jacob suggested this and fun to watch and educational.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41429/band-brothers-screaming-eagles">Band of Brothers</a> – This is my favorite easy-to-teach tactical WWII wargame. In fact my young friend (and future Army officer) Peter is coming over this afternoon for another session. That will be three plays in one week.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205059/mansions-madness-second-edition">Mansions of Madness</a> – Geoff and Lisa came over Sunday night and we played this semi-cooperative game. Technically “we won” but I went insane at the end and was forced to try to stop us from winning, and failed. Fun ride and a good successor to <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a> (but more complex).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engineers-guide-artificial-intelligence-galaxy-kai-fu-lee">An Engineer’s Guide to the Artificial Intelligence Galaxy.</a> – A better than average commencement speech from Columbia University with some aggressive forecasting of AI. I’m in agreement.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?</a> – When do things cross the line from “I don’t like it ’cause its different than how I grew up” to “this might be a genuine problem for our youth”?</li>
<li><a href="https://grownandflown.com/family-in-between-mom-loves/">My Family is “In Between”and I Love it</a> – Some heartfelt commentary from a mom that is in about the same stage of life as Julie and me. I’ve subscribed to the blog.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howimplaying">How I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because I’m engaging in a frugal month, playing golf doesn’t fit in the picture. So that means… disc golf! I’ve played a couple of new courses in my area over the past week and I’ll be heading to another tomorrow.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.discgolf.com/disc-golf-rules-for-recreational-play/">Disc Golf Rules for Recreational Play</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.heavydisc.com/2013/11/improving-back-hand-distance.html">Improving Back Hand Distance</a> – This is where I most need to improve.</li>
<li><a href="http://discgolf.discraft.com/res_overhand07_p1.html">The Overhand Shot</a> – I can still throw further with an overhand shot, but slowly my back hand is achieving similar distances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howimhackingmylife">How I’m Hacking my Life</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/priority-pass-adds-capers-cafe-le-bar-capers-market-pdx/">Priority Pass Adds Capers Cafe Le Bar &amp; Capers Market To PDX</a> – Holy cow what a great deal. When I flew to Dallas last week, I took advantage of my Priority Pass on both ends. I got $28 credit at Capers (Cobb salad and a glass of wine) and $28 at House Spirits Distillery on the way out. On the way back, I stopped by Capers again and got another salad, which lasted me for two meals when I got home. PDX might be the best airport on the planet for using the Priority Pass (also get Alaska Airlines lounge access).</li>
<li><a href="http://wealthyaccountant.com/2017/08/07/intermittent-fasting-versus-long-term-fasting/">Intermittent Fasting Versus Long-term Fasting</a> – I’m doing the 16/8 fasting model right now and it is easy for me to do. The problem is I’m also training for a half marathon and fasting before I do long (6+ mile) runs appears to be a terrible thing to do. At least my body is telling me that. So no more fasting before my runs the rest of the month, but I plan to resume this after the half marathon when I transition back into strength training combined with shorter runs.</li>
</ul>
