excerpt: " I was fortunate enough to get an invite to open a Gmail account from my
  friend Scott Ladewig.  Gmail is Google's answer to Yahoo, Hotmail and others: free
  internet-based email for the masses. I'm generally a POP3/IMAP sort of guy and avoid
  web-based email, but the convenience of a solid web mail solution with a nice interface
  is very attractive.  That's why I joined Oddpost about 9 months ago - it has an
  amazing web-based interface (IE only) and decent enough IMAP/POP3 support.  As good
  as Oddpost is, I've moved everything over to Gmail and plan to stay there.  Several
  reasons:  Oddpost has had some notoriously bad outages.  Service has improved, but
  I still see more downtime than I should. The client is a bit buggy. I've had a number
  of Javascript issues, mostly (IMO) due to synchronization challenges.  I don't think
  Oddpost likes IMAP clients very much. The way Gmail handles conversation threading
  is groundbreaking.  I liken it to gmane, though I think Gmail is even better.  I
  subscribe to several high traffic email lists, so by managing the threading effectively
  Gmail lets me filter out a lot of noise.  If don't care about a particular thread
  (like the rules arbitration for Goa and Maharaja happening on spielfrieks right
  now), I can delete or ignore dozens of messages at once my skipping a conversation.
  Search.  It is Google after all, right? Tons of storage.  1GB for now, and I doubt
  I'll need more any time soon. My major complaint right now (like others): lack of
  POP3 and IMAP support.  Hopefully they'll offer a paid service with this support
  in the future."
