excerpt: On Monday, Jacob and I ventured across town (about as far across town as
  you can imagine) to KC and Rita's home in Gresham.  KC, Rita, and I are planning
  a playtest day in November to further develop some of his game designs.  While we
  drilled down into the details, Jacob joined their kids for some HeroScape.         We
  combined our two sets, and the kids went crazy with their own design and scenario. 
  Half the fun with this game is the setup and playing with the minis.          Jacob
  designed an overhang ambush.  I wish I had focused on the guy inside to give a clearer
  view.         Jenna and her army.         Just in case you forgot how to fit your
  minis back into the plastic, here's your guide.         Taj Mahal has been on my
  must play list for quite some time based on reputation.  I knew next to nothing
  about the game, but found it easy to learn and very enjoyable to play.  I like it
  when I can think of a rational plan and execute against it, feeling at least a bit
  in control of my destiny.  Taj Mahal certainly offers that and more.  I managed
  to win, but I think they everyone was being kind.
