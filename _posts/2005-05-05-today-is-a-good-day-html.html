excerpt: I heard the Replacements on the radio this morning (Can't Hardly Wait off
  of Pleased to Meet Me) - that's something that doesn't happen very often so it must
  be good omen.  For what, I don't know. Also, Julie and I have both committed to
  competing in a sprint triathlon this summer - the Mid-Summer Triathlon at Blue Lake. 
  That is if they can keep the lake free from E. Coli.  I taught myself Total Immersion
  swimming last year (at least I think I did, and am actually able to swim distances
  now) thanks to inspiration from my friend John Hibbard.  Julie and I agreed that
  we need a concrete goal to shoot for as a motivational source and this sounds like
  a good choice.  Maybe we'll do the Lincoln City sprint triathlon in September. 
  There, I said it and made it public, so now I guess I have to do it.
