excerpt: "                             I have at least two session reports to post,
  one from the             gaming at Kevin Graham’s a few weeks ago, and one from
  my trip to Burbank, CA.              I’ve also been playing some games with the
  family, most notably:                               ·         Formula             De
  – picked this up cheap at WOTC                               ·         Star             Wars:
  Epic Duals                               ·         Puerto             Rico – finally
  played with Jacob                               ·         Star             Wars
  RPG                               ·         Dungeons             and Dragons, 3E
  (yes, both Jacob and Matthew are playing D&D)                               I’m
  heading to Dallas, TX (my place of birth!) next week for             TechEd, so
  I’ll try and hook up with some gaming Tue or Wed night there.
