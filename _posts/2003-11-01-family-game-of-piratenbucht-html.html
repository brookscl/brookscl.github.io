excerpt: 'Julie, Jacob, Matthew, and I sat down for a game of Piratenbucht this afternoon. 
  It was a busy day with other activities, but with 3 hours free in the afternoon
  it sounded like a great idea.  This is probably our most played family game with
  all four of us - a fun dice fest with a great theme.  My strategy was mostly avoidance
  of the other players, and it worked out well.  I didn''t have to fight anyone until
  I had built up my ship, and then I couldn''t lose.  I raced out ahead in fame points
  and quickly became a target for everyone else.  I also didn''t make any friends
  by tipping off the Royal Navy...    Jacob had terrible luck - if he wasn''t fighting
  a stronger player, he had to face Blackbeard.  We play with the variant where Blackbeard
  moves either 1 or 2 islands after the players have moved, so you never know where
  he''s going to end up (though he is easy to avoid).  Sometimes you just really want
  to get that treasure on an island where he may be headed though.  At game end, I
  thought I had it wrapped up - an eight point lead on the closest competitor (Julie),
  with only tall tales to reveal.  I only had one (I discovered Atlantis), but Julie
  racked up 10 points!  The picture below is where Julie revealed that she was, in
  fact, Blackbeard all along.     We were running out of time, so we declared me the
  winner since I had more gold.  I think we were supposed to fight another head-to-head
  battle, which she probably would have won. '
