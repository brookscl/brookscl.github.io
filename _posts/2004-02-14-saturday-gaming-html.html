excerpt: 'After spending 4 hours this morning at Beaverton Toyota getting my car worked
  on (regular maintenance plus some repairs from vandalism at the Portland airport),
  I joined Jacob and Matthew at the Rude household for Brandon''s birthday.  No photos
  from that event, though I do have one from our evening play of Vanished Planet.
  Trias Ken and I played the two-player variant of Trias, the game of plate tectonics
  and dinosaur migration.  There have been some complaints about the theme of this
  game, claiming that it is too dry or abstract.  I love the theme!  I can visualize
  the continents forming and the dinosaurs migrating (and swimming).  This game plays
  better with more than two, but we had a good time and a very close finish with my
  just edging Ken out. Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers This is now my favorite
  version of Carcassonne.  I like the scoring in this as there appears to be more
  equity between the rivers and forests (as opposed to the roads and castles in the
  original).  The addition of the bonus tiles adds a fun dynamic.  This was a close
  game as well, with me beating Ken by less than 10 points in a 120+ point game. Coloretto
  Ken, Tracey, and I played a single hand of Coloretto, with Ken winning the hand
  with 37 points. Vanished Planet Jacob, Matthew, and I broke out my new copy of Vanished
  Planet.  Feedback on this cooperative game has been very mixed, but it is a winner
  in our house.  The boys absolutely love the theme, and cooperative games are a great
  family activity (especially in a competitive household like ours).        Jacob
  and Matthew study the galaxy for the perfect move.Matthew summed up the critical
  flaw with this game perfectly: “I keep forgetting what the symbols are.”  This game
  could be so much better with improved usability!  One task I''ve given myself is
  an improved quick reference card which I plan to post before too long.  We played
  on the easiest setting and managed to win the game, thanks to a few well placed
  mines to hold of the Creature.  We scored 17 goal points.'
