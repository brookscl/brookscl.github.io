excerpt: Sunday at BGG.CON - the exodus begins and gamers try to fit in an as many
  games as they can before the library closes. Jim had been lugging around his copy
  of Martin Wallace's Toledo - a game under my radar for some odd reason given how
  much I enjoy his games.  This is on the lighter end of the Wallace spectrum. My
  comparison - Ticket to Ride combined with Aladdin's Dragon without the blind bidding.
  How's that? Check out the 'geek if you need a more detailed description. Fun game
  that I happened to win but this game didn't jump on my wish list.  Next up was the
  new Knizia / Valley Games release Municipium with Hamzy and Jasen Robillard. The
  production quality is very high on this game (but pink as a player color?).  The
  game - I'm not sure what to think. This is certainly a deeper Knizia release compared
  to what we've seen lately and that is very welcome. Still, this isn't Amun Re or
  Tigris & Euphrates - there's a decent amount of player chaos in the game as you
  try to capture majorities to trigger prize attainment or special actions. I'll have
  to try this one again before considering a purchase.  Oh, and Jasen let me borrow
  his nifty 12-24mm wide angle zoom lens for the following shot.  That's it for the
  day-by-day reports. Next up I'll wrap up all of the games I played in a summary
  report.
