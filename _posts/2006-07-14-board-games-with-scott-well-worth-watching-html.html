excerpt: I haven’t talked much lately about gaming podcasts, but I just have to say
  how much I like Board Games with Scott.  Scott’s a little goofy (who in this hobby
  isn’t?), but he does a really nice job on production and he clearly has put in a
  great deal of thought into staging and producing this series.  I can’t wait to watch
  the Die Macher episode. There are some subtleties to how he produces the show that
  lead to very digestible download times – notice how many of his scenes involve very
  little changing scenery.  He holds his head still against a high contrast background,
  uses many shots where he has a fixed camera pointing to the game board with just
  his hand moving bits around, etc.  Keep up the good work.
