<p>I finally broke down and placed another <a href="http://www.deepthoughtgames.com/">Deep Thought Games</a> 18xx game order. I still have two unplayed 18xx game in my collection (<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/424/1870">1870</a> and <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/816/2038">2038</a>) but I feel compelled to get in the queue and hedge a bit knowing there's at least one game I really want to own: <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17405/1846">1846</a>.  I played it for the second time in a year over the weekend and it is becoming one of my favorites.  What I like: innovative opening draft of privates (simpler and more comfortable for newbies when compared to auctions), quick ramp of companies and route building, and minimal stock market shenanigans.  Not that I don't like stock market wackiness at times, its just nice knowing going in that you can focus on engineering good routes and observing others' growth potential.</p>
<p>Also ordered were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4613/1854">1854</a> - the smaller map and European setting are attractive to me, though this looks to be a longish game which I don't mind.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38986/18neb">18Neb</a> - I'm a sucker for games that focus on geography I've lived in, and I'm looking for a second shorter game that Jacob and Matthew might both play with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I reserve the right to add games to this order before Deep Thought gets to my spot in the queue!</p>
