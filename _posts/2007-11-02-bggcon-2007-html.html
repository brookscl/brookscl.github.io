excerpt: " Two weeks from now I'll be at BGG.CON.  Are you going?  If so, leave a
  comment so we can meetup there.  I'm really looking forward to this.  Why?        I'm
  going as a gamer, not a vendor     I'm rooming with Greg Schloesser, so there should
  be some great conversation.  I hope he doesn't snore much.  I missed Essen, so this
  will be a good chance to play new releases.    I'll get to see oooold friends like
  Jim Ginn and Tim Isaakson.  Other than GameStorm last spring, this is the only con
  I'll attend this year.   "
