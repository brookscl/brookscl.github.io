We are settled in Hurricane Cliffs, a dispersed camping area above La Verkin, UT. This will be our home for a few days as we explore Zion again, repeating a few items we enjoyed last time ([climbing to Angel's Landing for example](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2018/04/19/zion-angels-landing/)) and checking off a few that we missed last time around. Highlight should be wading through the [Virgin River narrows](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm) on Tuesday.

Crowds will likely be crazy tomorrow on Easter Sunday as we tackle Angel's Landing, but we do have a 7am ticket on the Zion shuttle so should be one of the first groups at the trailhead. We are pretty speedy.
