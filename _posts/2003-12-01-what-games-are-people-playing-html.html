excerpt: 'Mark Jackson took some time to summarize what are called “5 and 10” or “five
  and dime” reports culled from spielfrieks early this year.  This was a bit late
  in coming, but better late than never. The results were taken from 64 different
  gamers, with 5 points awarded if the gameshowed up on their five list (played 5-9
  times) and 10 points if the game showed upon their dime list (played 10+ times). 
  Here is a list of the top 10:    Game Points % 01 Rank 00 Rank 99 Rank  Puerto Rico
  395 74% new n/a n/a  Carcassonne 355 60% 1st 24th new  Settlers of Catan 215 43%
  5th 1st 3rd  Crokinole 210 37% 5th 136th 62nd  Liar''s Dice / Bluff / Perudo 200
  37% 2nd 7th 8th  Transamerica 190 42% new n/a n/a  Lost Cities 150 32% 3rd 2nd 1st  Can''t
  Stop 125 28% 11th 7th 11th  Take 6 125 26% 33rd 15th 40th  Bohnanza 110 22% 9th
  20th 16th The games on the list clearly fall into a few distinct categories: light
  filler games that people tend to play frequently (Liar''s Dice, Can''t Stop, Transamerica,
  Lost Cities, Take 6) and deeper strategic games that are hugely popular (Puerto
  Rico, Settlers).  The game in a category by itself, dexterity games, is Crokinole. 
  You can put Carcassonne in either the light filler category or deeper game depending
  on your preference :-).  I''ve played all of these games except for Lost Cities
  and Take 6.  Actually I''ve played Lost Cities online against an AI, but never in
  real life.  Judging from the session reports I''ve been reading so far this year,
  it looks like Puerto Rico will again be at the top of the list for 2003.  A few
  predictions for new games that we might see in the top 10 for 2003:   Age of Steam
  - the only thing that could keep this off the list is its length, which can lower
  the number of plays.  Pirate''s Cove / Piratenbucht - the Days of Wonder release
  of the English version of this great game might push it into the top 10.  Amun Re
  - a long shot. Likely it will be tough to displace some of the tried-and-true fillers
  (like Can''t Stop and Liar''s Dice) and classics. '
