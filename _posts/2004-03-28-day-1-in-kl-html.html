excerpt: After a breakfast here in the hotel this morning, I went for a stroll to
  see what is near the hotel.  I wandered into the KLCC shopping complex, a very modern
  western-style mall with an interesting mix of local flavor and name-brand stores. 
  I managed to resist the Starbucks - who needs a hot latte when it is 90 deg outside?        What
  would we do without our Starbucks? My friend Trevor took some time out of his Sunday
  to get me acquainted with the area.  We talked for a while about our business plans
  for the week, then proceeded to visit some of the tourist spots near my hotel.        The
  twin Petronas towers. Trevor has a new office (he shares with our regional partner)
  in one of the Petronas towers, so we took the elevator up to the 50th floor for
  some fantastic views.        The Menara Kuala Lumpur. Trevor and I hopped in a taxi
  to go see the Menara Kuala Lumpur, a very impressive telecommunications tower. 
  At the top I listened to an audio tour that describes the skyline from various vantage
  points.        View of Dataran Merdeka (Merdeka Square) from Menara Kuala Lumpur.
  One of the interesting views was of Dataran Merdeka, named after the Malay word
  for independence.  You can see the very large flagpole to the left of the field
  - it was here at midnight on August 31, 1957 that the Union Jack was lowered for
  the last time and Malaysia (then Malaya) became an independent state.        Another
  view of the Petronas towers.  To the right (the big white complex) is the KLCC shopping
  center.  To the right of that is the Mandarin Oriental hotel, where I am staying.
  The rains come like clockwork here each day around 3-4pm.  At 3:15pm today, a tropical
  thunderstorm rolled through.  As of 5:00pm, it is mostly clear again.        Thunderstorm
  view from my room.
