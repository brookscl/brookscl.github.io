excerpt: 'Day 2 at GenCon is at a close, and here''s my report for the day.  Today
  was quite different - less time at the show, and I brought Matthew and Jacob today. 
  We were up pretty late last night watching the Olympics, so we slept in a bit and
  arrived at the show around 9:15am.  I was scheduled to be on duty at Days of Wonder
  at 10am; we used our time to sign Matthew up for the RPGA and ask some questions
  about our D&D campaign on Sunday.  We are participating in a Living Greyhawk adventure,
  which is a pretty cool concept.  More on that tomorrow. Things worked out well on
  the show floor.  I let Matthew and Jacob roam using the buddy system, checking back
  every 30 minutes.  They were able to get in demos of the Neopets CCG and Pirates
  of the Spanish Main.  I spent my entire shift on Memoir ''44 this time, playing
  two complete games.  Both demos were converted to sales, which is always nice. 
  Also, while giving demos at DoW, Rick Thornquist was nice enough to stop by and
  chat.  I''ve been a big fan of Rick''s writings for some time, so it was great to
  finally meet in person. We did some shopping after my shift.  I picked up the new
  FFG game Colossal Arena, the new version of the classic Knizia Titan: the Arena. 
  I used a coupon at the AEG booth and purchased two starter decks of Spycraft, getting
  a free booster in the process. We were scheduled for an afternoon session of Big
  Eyes, Small Mouth (BESM), the light Anime role-playing game.  Jacob and I both wanted
  to own the rules to this game, so we stopped by the Guardians of Order booth and
  purchased the 2nd edition rulebook.  Our last purchase of the day was three GenCon
  t-shirts from the gift shop, also using a handy coupon. After a quick lunch in the
  exhibit hall, Matthew was eager to sit in one of the Anime theaters to watch a short
  movie.  After scouting out each of the 4 (!) theaters for age-appropriate material,
  we settled on one theater and watched a show for about 25 minutes.  Good stuff,
  but it was part of a series so took a while to get a sense for the plot. We wrapped
  up the day with our BESM session - more on the below with the photos. I do want
  to commend the GenCon staff for fixing many of the problems I noticed last year
  (I''m sure they were widely reported).  I''ve seen very few lines and mixups with
  the events. Scheduled Gaming         This is the RPG room where we played BESM. 
  There was also quite a bit of D&D going on in the same place.           The adventure
  we played was Groundhog Recess, an event put on by The Impossible Dream.  The setting
  was Advanced Dimensional Green Ninja-Educational Preparatory Super-Elementary Fortress
  555, a setting that involves elementary students with often super-hero qualities
  and flaws.  What a perfect setting for Jacob and Matthew!  This picture is a relationship
  graph showing the main characters and their linkages to other people in the story.         Jacob
  took on the role of Timmy, a young boy that befriends a 50 foot robot.          Matthew
  played a furry dog that is able to walk on two legs and speak.  He also happens
  to be a surgeon.         That''s our gamemaster Akira - he was amazing!  He kept
  us all entertained throughout the event.         So why the name Groundhog Recess? 
  Well, the plotline was that we were doomed to repeat the same recess over and over
  again until we determined what events we needed to prevent/change in order to restore
  balance to the universe.  Or at least our playground.  Oh, I played a kindergartner
  who also happens to be a mad scientist. GenCon Sites and Sounds         A photo
  from one of my demo sessions of Memoir ''44.  Hey, and that''s Dale Larson on the
  left, creator of Cyberboard, a PBEM board gaming system for Windows.  I''m currently
  using that for a slow-running game (my own fault!) of Europe Engulfed.         Our
  lunch break in the exhibit hall.  Mmmm, healthy nachos and brats.         Who ya
  gonna call?         Matthew with the pirate Jack Sparrow.'
