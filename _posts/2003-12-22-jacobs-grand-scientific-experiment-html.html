excerpt: Jacob has the opportunity at school to do some extra projects (reading assignments,
  math, and now science).  He designed an experiment around plant growth with different
  watering conditions.  The question he wanted to answer was “how does the temperature
  of the air and water affect the growth of pea and bean plants.”  His hypothesis
  was that the plants would only grow with warm air and cool (not hot) water.  So
  he planted four seeds outside and four inside (two each of bean and pea). He did
  some great work on this project, taking digital photos and tracking progress along
  the way.  He also did most of the computer work for his final report poster, including
  some nice work in Microsoft Publisher.  Here he is finishing the final report.        Jacob
  works on his final report.Oh yeah - the results.  As you might suspect, hot water
  doesn't help seeds grow, and the cold air outside didn't help much either.  The
  seeds he planted inside and watered with cool water grew very well.
