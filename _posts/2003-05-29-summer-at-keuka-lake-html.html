excerpt: "                            We will make our annual trek to Keuka             Lake
  in western New York in July.  Julie and the boys usually take the train,             but
  since we have a shorter time window this year (Jacob’s baseball season is             longer),
  they’ll fly out.  I’ll probably join them July 1 –             July 10.  We are
  just up the west lake road from the Keuka             Yacht Club, and my favorite
  pastime there is sailing the Flying Dutchman and the             Sunfish.               "
