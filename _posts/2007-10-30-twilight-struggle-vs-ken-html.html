excerpt: " Ken and I got together about 2 weeks ago to play Twilight Struggle.  This
  currently ranks as my favorite-game-that-I-rarely-get-to-play.  Ken was concerned
  about the rumors he's heard that the game is broken in some way, but I assured him
  that it is just a bit imbalanced towards to Soviets.  I offered to play the USA
  to perhaps balance out experience vs inherent imbalance and it seemed to work out
  just fine.    I was fortunate to draw the European and Middle East scoring cards
  and control the timing in the early war, which helped mitigate losses for me and
  keep me in the positive VP territory for the early war and into the middle war.
  \ I worked very hard to keep the Soviets out of Central America by holding the Castro
  card for most of the early game but he made inroads with (I think) de-colonization
  anyway.  Ken learned quickly about scoring and momentum and adjusted in real time
  quite nicely, balancing out the VPs mid-way through the middle war and setting up
  a potentially exciting finish.  Unfortunately it just got too late for both of us
  (around 11pm or so - we didn't start until after 8pm) so we called it a night.  We
  both look forward to a re-match.  I also can't wait to try out the new 1960: The
  Making of the President... "
