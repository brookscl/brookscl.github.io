excerpt: I'm sitting in the Red Carpet lounge at PDX, doing some demo work for Corillian
  and waiting for my flight to SFO.  I'll end my journey in Melbourne, Australia sometime
  on Saturday morning.  Mostly meetings next week, but as I'm arriving early (about
  $1500 cheaper leaving today rather than Friday), I'll have some time to explore
  Melbourne on Saturday while I try and stay awake and shift time zones.
