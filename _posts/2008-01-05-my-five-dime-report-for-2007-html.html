excerpt: " I just finished tabulating my games played for 2007 for Mark Jackson's
  annual Five & Dime report. This was a down year for me in terms of total games played
  (only 154) mostly due to a serious lull in gaming as I was finishing up my work
  around the CheckFree / Corillian acquisition then transitioning to, ahem, mini-retired
  life.  I had one session a month in May, June, and July, then recorded zero games
  played until September.  Things got back into full swing at BGG.CON and I've resumed
  my regular playing habits.   For reference here is my  2003 Report.  Tabulating
  was harder this year as I recorded my games played manually in my Game Journal.
  \ As the year went on, more and more I was tracking games played in my Field Notes
  notebook, so in 2008 I'm just going to record sessions in BGG.  Dimes:      Magic:
  the Gathering   Nickels:      Command & Colors: Ancients     Combat Commander: Europe
  \  Arkadia    18xx   Race for the Galaxy    Foppen     Werewolf   Tichu   Almost
  made the cut with 4 plays:     Canal Mania    Brass   Clearly there's a healthy
  dose of heavy games on this list, and as predicted last year my game playing and
  purchasing has taken a swing towards wargames.  This also reflects a trend in my
  local gaming group. "
