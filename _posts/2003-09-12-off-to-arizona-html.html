excerpt: 'Tonight I''ll be speaking at a Software Association of Oregon Web Services
  Panel, then tomorrow morning I take an early flight to Phoenix, Arizona.  Next week
  is the American Banker Online 2003 conference at which I''ll be on another panel
  where we''ll discuss the future of online financial services.  Never one to miss
  out on a chance to mix some fun with business, I''m leaving tomorrow morning so
  I can spend a couple of days learning how to (better?) play golf.  I''ll give a
  report sometime this weekend on my progress.  Also, Saturday night I hope to hook
  up with the Arizona Boardgamers, who were kind enough to invite me over for some
  gaming fun.  Hopefully I won''t be too dried up from the blistering heat to enjoy
  myself. '
