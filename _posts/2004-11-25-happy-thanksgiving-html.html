excerpt: 'We had a great day here at the coast.  Before the details, first a little
  turkey day Haiku I composed:  Turkey be afraid:Dinner comes before it''s dark,Best
  act like a duck.         The day started with a beautiful sunrise over Siletz Bay. 
  The wind stayed down today making for some very pleasant beach time.         Before
  the big meal we all took a hike out on the beach.         There are some beautiful
  grass dunes along the beach area.         A sneaker wave jumped up and bit grandma
  Jan creating a slightly scary but mostly humorous scene.  Note the streams of water
  dripping off her fingers.         In the afternoon we played Boomtown.  It was quite
  fun (despite the apparent high level of boredom shown in this picture).  There are
  some cool mechanics in this game - with some chaos of course, as is typical with
  Bruno''s games.         Dinner was traditional and fabulous.  Here Jacob''s accusing
  Julie of taking a bite before everyone sat down.  '
