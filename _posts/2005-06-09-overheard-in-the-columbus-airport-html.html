excerpt: 'I''m sitting here in Columbus, OH (free wireless!) waiting for my delayed
  flight to Chicago and then home in Portland.  So, I''m looking out the window and
  lo and behold there''s a C-5 Galaxy on the runway getting ready to take off.  There''s
  a business-exec looking guy on a cell phone near me looking out the window, and
  he notices the plane too (hard to miss).  This is what I hear him say:  There''s
  some sort of military plane here getting ready to take off.  I don''t know what
  kind it is... but it looks sort of stealthy. Hmmm.  Stealthy.  C-5.  Sure...'
