excerpt: 'Trying out the Amigo card game Der Elefant here in the conference room at
  the Arosa. This is about the classic "elephant in the china shop" story (? I thought
  it was a bull).  According to Erik it has a series of scoring rounds similar to
  Too Many Cooks. I''ve played that game and have no clue what he''s talking about,
  so I''ll ask what to do each turn. Interesting element: everyone plays with their
  cards face up, so there''s no hidden information in the game.  We are now scoring
  our first round and I have no idea what I''ve done except I scored the worst. Apparently
  I score my own china shop and I get to choose whether to count it as the lowest
  in each color, highest in each, highest overall, or sum of a total color.  Like
  many German card games the subtleties are... well, subtle. You''ve got to play a
  game or two to understand how to control the scoring. At least that''s my excuse.  Second
  round - scored ALL of my cards for 26, which seems like a decent score. And I''m
  hardly paying attention (I''m blogging after all).  Third round - things are going
  really well. Scored highest in each color for a 22, which is very decent. Even excellent.  Final
  round - did well again and won the game with 75. Have no idea why. Hmmmm.'
