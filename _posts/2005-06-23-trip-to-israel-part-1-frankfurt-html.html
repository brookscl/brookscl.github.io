excerpt: 'I had hoped to post some of this trip content while on the road, but generally
  poor internet connectivity in my rooms in Israel combined with an extremely hectic
  work schedule precluded me from doing so. My colleague Erich and I departed for
  Israel last Tuesday.  Lufthansa has a daily non-stop flight to Frankfurt that is
  quite convenient and allowed us to connect into Ben Gurion airport with only one
  stop.  The downside (sorta) is a 12 hour layover in Frankfurt.  Rather than sit
  around the airport for the day, Erich and I ventured into downtown on the S8 subway
  to the Hauptwache stop, conveniently located near the Zeilgalerie.  This is a vibrant
  shopping area and was a great place to shop, people-watch, and hunt for some games.         The
  game selection at the Gamestore in the Zeilgalerie. Only a five minute walk from
  the subway stop is the Gamestore in the Zeilgalerie.  This is a traditional hobby
  game store like you might find in the US, with a broad selection of RPGs, miniatures,
  CCGs, and family boardgames.  Prices were very comparable to the US but I found
  a few decent deals on card games.  I picked up Sticheln and Geschenkt for a total
  of about 13 euros. Erich and I then proceeded to do some museum hopping, visiting
  the Goethe Museum and the Museum of Modern Art.  Both were OK, not spectacular. 
  The Goethe museum had too little content on his actual works, and too much content
  on the artists that surrounded him at the time.  The modern art museum had some
  interesting exhibits but was very small in comparison to others I have seen and
  nothing overwhelmed me.         Erich and I stopped for a drink at a floating bar/restaurant
  on the Main river. We spent a good part of the late afternoon just walking around
  the city, especially the attractive waterfront around the Main river.  The city
  seemed to be much cleaner and vibrant than when I last visited in 1990. We ended
  the day with some more shopping in the main department store at the Zeilgalerie. 
  Erich was looking for some action figures for his 5 year old son, so we headed up
  to the 6th floor toy section.  I was pretty blown away by the game collection there.         The
  game section of the department store. The selection in this store was larger than
  that of the game store, with a wide range of games including a decent collection
  of American games.  There were some great deals here as well: New England for 10
  euros, some good clearance items for 5 euros (I picked up Hellas).  These games
  certainly are more mainstream in Germany than in the US.  I wonder if we''ll ever
  see a selection like this in a Target? Next it was back to the airport to catch
  our flight to Israel.  More on that later...'
