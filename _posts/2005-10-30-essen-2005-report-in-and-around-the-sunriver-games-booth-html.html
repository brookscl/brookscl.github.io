excerpt: 'For my first Essen Spiel report I thought I’d focus on the Sunriver Games
  booth.  This was such a learning experience for us rank amateurs, but I think we
  pulled it off with very few snafus. Julie, the boys, and I arrived in Essen just
  after noon on Tuesday, October 11.  We checked into our room at the Hotel Arosa
  and started to notice some other gamer folks hanging around the hotel, including
  Lorna, Doug, and Mimi.  After grabbing a bite to eat, we walked over to the Messe
  so that I could check out the booth and see if our rented furniture had arrived.  It
  was a bit strange finding my way into the hall – I figured one of the main doors
  would be open to those with exhibitor passes.  I finally approached the security
  guard at the drive-in gate near the south entrance, showed him my pass, and he let
  me through.  I was surprised at how little had been setup yet – most notable was
  the Settlers of Catan Bus, but very few of the smaller exhibitor booths showed signs
  of any action yet.  I quickly found the way to our booth (4–52) but was slightly
  disappointed to see no furniture there.  I was stumped about how to resolve this,
  so I wandered around for a while looking for someone official.  Nobody looked official. 
  The most common site was folks drinking beer while constructing booths.   Eventually
  I referred to my layout map and discovered the service center over by Hall 5.  Inside
  the center I found a very helpful woman who noted my request for furniture, confirmed
  my reservation, and spent some time on the phone with someone.  About five minutes
  later she told me the furniture would be there within an hour.  I wasn’t going to
  setup Tuesday anyway, so it was good to know it would be in place for setup on Wednesday
  morning. Wednesday morning we used our rental car to drop off all of the Havoc product. 
  You can drive a car into the parking setup area if you have an exhibitor pass and
  a 50 euro deposit, which you get back as long as you leave within an hour.  We hauled
  our goods the short trip through hall 5, through the 4A hallway, then to our booth
  in hall 4.  Still no furniture.  I walked back to the service center and they were
  surprised the furniture wasn’t there, got on the phone, and indicated that perhaps
  it was left at the wrong booth and that they would fix it promptly.  By the time
  I returned to the booth, a mover was carting our tables to our booth – they were
  sitting just behind our booth at another (4–62 I think). Booth setup took very little
  time as we didn’t have much to do.  The biggest challenge was cutting down our fabric
  table covers to fit the tables.  In hindsight we wish we had brought a larger hanging
  tarp or cloth to drape from the booth wall.  To this we could have attached banners,
  price information, etc. without risk of damaging the walls.  As it was, we taped
  them to the booth walls but had a hard time getting the residue off at the end.
  KC and I took a break from setup to attend the press event.  There were definitely
  some lessons learned here.  You need to let the Spiel folks that (1) you have a
  new product you are releasing at Essen, and (2) register to show that product at
  the press event. This would have allowed us to setup a small table on Tuesday or
  Wednesday morning with our goods and have a formal presence at the event.  As it
  was, we lurked, passed out cards pointing to our booth, and left some press flyers
  for folks to take (they were all taken within about 15 minutes).  So we did OK,
  but lesson learned for next year. We stayed around the hall till early evening as
  we had a decent amount of traffic without the show even being open – we probably
  sold 10–20 copies of the game on Wed afternoon.  It was also a chance to checkout
  the used game vendors in hall 4 and see if there were any good deals. Thursday morning
  presented a few logistics issues as we tried to coordinate pass purchases and get
  as many of our demo team in as early as possible.  I was able to buy three more
  exhibitor passes and hand those out, but there was no easy way to buy 4–day passes
  for general admission ahead of time.  Things worked out fine despite the huge crowds
  on Thursday morning.  By 10:30am our demos were in full swing.  We sold about 80
  of our 310 games on the first day, which was a big surprise.  We extrapolated this
  out with some projected growth and though we might sell out as early as Saturday
  evening.  Thursday would turn out to be our best day, which I think is indication
  of some of the pre-show buzz we worked up and the niche attraction of Havoc: the
  Hundred Years War.  We would do reasonably well with walk-up sales, but due to the
  remote nature of our booth most folks that came by were looking for us. We had a
  number of “celebrities” come by the booth.  Mik Svellov…  Andrea Meyer…   and Derk
  Solko came by and interviewed Jacob and Julie.   KC, Julie, Jacob, and I would have
  been overwhelmed giving demos were it not for the help of our demo assistants. 
  Doug, Mimi, Lorna (all pictured below), Mike, Richard, and Ben: thanks for your
  time and dedication to making this event work.  Ben and Mike both knocked our socks
  off by giving demos in German.  I think Mike even surprised himself.  Cleanup on
  Sunday evening was more about getting a TON of boxes ready to ship back with Funagain
  than actually cleaning up our booth, though we did need to expend some serious energy
  cleaning the booth walls of residue.  We wrapped up by around 7:15 and worked our
  way back to the hotel for a final evening of gaming.  Well, that about wraps it
  up.  The event was a great success on so many levels, new friendships were forged,
  and we met our objectives with Havoc.  We are already planning for our trip next
  year, and if things go well we might even have a booth again with another game to
  sell. '
