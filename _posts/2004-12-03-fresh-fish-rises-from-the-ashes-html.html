excerpt: 'Looks like I have permission from Plenary Games, publisher of the fine Fresh
  Fish game, to resume development work of the Windows-based implementation of the
  game I started last year. Now, I''m not sure how much time I have available to work
  on this, but I certainly do have a to-do list of items to work on that includes:  Building
  an AI for solitaire play. Including peer-to-peer or server-based network play for
  multiplayer. Improving the interface to look more like a game and not a Windows
  business app. I''ve maintained this as open source from the start, and am willing
  to push it out to Sourceforge or something similar if there are others out there
  interested in collaborating.Â  Just let me know.'
