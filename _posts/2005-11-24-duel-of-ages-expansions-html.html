excerpt: OK, all you Duel of Ages experts out there – what expansion brings the most
  bang for the buck?  Tom, you said in a review on BGG that people should buy the
  Masters Addendum if they buy only one expansion.  You also said that (1–2 years
  earlier) about set 2!  It looks like Set 2 contains additional platters, which I
  think is important for replayability and bigger setups.  The Masters Addendum doesn’t
  contain platters, right?  So I’m leaning towards set 2.  Thoughts?
