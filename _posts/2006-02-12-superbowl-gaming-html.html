excerpt: 'Mike hosted another great day of Superbowl gaming last weekend and posted
  a detailed session report.  I finally got around to editing some photos that you
  can see here in my flickr set.  I don’t have much to add other than a few more details
  about the game of Tigris and Euphrates that Julie managed to join.  After agreeing
  to play, she wandered over to my Pizza Box football game to ask “is this the sort
  of game I’ll like?”  I grimaced and expressed my surprise that she volunteered to
  play, but quickly put on a happy face and indicated that she just might like it.  As
  so often happens in situations like this, Julie managed to win it what turned out
  to be an oddly short and low-scoring game (I think she won with 6 or 7 points). 
  I think the game was shorter due to an usual number of tile discard and re-draws. '
