excerpt: I just won (a rare event) an online game of Alhambra at Boiteajeaux, and
  I must say it is the strangest game I’ve played there (or anywhere).   I had a great
  start, running out ahead of the rest of the players in this four-player game early
  on.  My problem was that I boxed myself in with my nice Alhambra wall.  The last
  seven tiles I purchased all went straight to my reserve.  I had decent currency
  matches that allowed me to do this – I figured depriving other players of their
  points was worth the effort, and I planned at some point to swap out the lower white
  tile to open up my wall again.  In the end I won 112–95–94–74.
