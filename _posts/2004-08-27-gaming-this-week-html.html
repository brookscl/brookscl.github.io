excerpt: 'I managed to get in a few games this week, both at home with Matthew and
  at Die Hard Thursday with the RipCity gamers. Wednesday night, Matthew and I had
  some 1:1 time during Jacob''s football practice, so we decided to give St. Petersburg
  a try - a first play for both of us.  I was a bit concerned that the complexity
  might be too high for Matthew, but the mechanics of this game are exceedingly simple
  (even if the strategy isn''t).  Matthew had no problems at all with the game, even
  rating it a 10 out of 10 (not quite as high as he rates HeroScape though, which
  gets a 100 out of 100). I read the rules several times prior to playing so I had
  a decent understanding of gameplay, but it was particularly hard for me to understand
  how the game would play out, how many turns it would last, what cards would get
  discarded, etc.  As it turns out, I was in for quite a schooling by Matthew as he
  took a very basic strategy and ended up beating me pretty soundly.         Matthew
  trying to explain to me that it really is a simple game and that I shouldn''t have
  to work so hard to beat him. First, let me explain the basic mechanics of the game
  in case you aren''t familiar.  There are four types of cards that you can buy in
  the game, and these card types also match up with the four phases of each turn:
  workers, buildings, aristocrats, and trading cards.  In general, workers generate
  income, buildings generate victory points, aristocrats generate both, and trading
  cards are basically upgrades to workers, buildings, and aristocrats.  As you go
  through the four phases, you score the corresponding card types under your control
  at the end of the phase.  So if I purchase two workers in the worker phase, they
  will immediately produce income for me at the end of that phase. There are two rows
  where cards go - the first row is where new cards are brought in at the beginning
  of the phase.  Except at the start of the game for less than 4 players, you always
  refresh the board so that there are a total of 8 cards available for purchase. 
  So at the beginning of the worker phase, if there are four cards on the board (which
  would automatically be moved to the second row), four worker cards would be drawn
  and placed in the first row.  It is possible that no cards will be drawn if there
  were still 8 cards on the board, which would happen if nobody took a card the prior
  phase.  There are tokens to mark who goes first in each of the four phases, and
  these rotate to the left at the end of each turn.  The first player takes an action,
  either draw a card into his hand (to a max of 3 cards), purchase a card, or play
  a card from his hand.  Cards that are drawn into the hand are not purchased - they
  are being held for future purchase.  This is a good way to grab a card that you''ll
  want to play later but can''t afford to purchase immediately.  Play rotates to the
  left and continues until everyone passes in succession. The game ends at the end
  a complete turn when one of the stacks of cards is exhausted.  At this time, additional
  victory points are attained by the number of unique aristocrats that a player holds
  - this is a key path to victory so part of any player''s strategy will likely be
  to obtain at least 7, and probably all 10, unique aristocrats. I figured this out
  early, but I didn''t have a sense for how many aristocrats were left in the draw
  pile.  I also didn''t realize until too late that several had already been discarded.
  So on the last turn, while Matthew is just buying whatever he could afford (which
  included some very large and profitable buildings), I was holding some cash in the
  hope of picking up 2 more aristocrats, and the only ones that came up were ones
  I already owned!  So I ended the game with 49 rubles and lost by about 10 points
  to Matthew.  I''ll know better next time. Last night I played Puerto Rico and Princes
  of Florence (finally - my first play!).  George puts it best:  First up by my request
  was Puerto Rico. Dave was insisting on notsitting to my left, so Mike took one for
  the team. ;-) Dave and Istarted to build the same small market, but our strategies
  soon partedthereafter. While I tried to make lots of points off my corn glut andwharf,
  Dave kept up with his factory and harbor. Mike''s harbor broughthim back in the
  later part of the game. Chris was following anOffice/Factory strategy that resulted
  in building three largebuildings in the end. Final scores: Dave 55, Chris 51, George
  38, Mike 37Dave remembered that Chris had requested Princes of Florence for awhile
  now so I pulled out my translated German copy. Not much to sayhere as Dave pulled
  his Jester/Most Works strategy out again to showus how the game is supposed to be
  played.Final scores: Dave, George, Mike (good comeback), Chris. I enjoyed Princes
  of Florence - it has quite a few moving parts and I''m still burning some cycles
  thinking about the game.  I wonder if there''s a clearer path to victory that stands
  up over multiple games/opponents than Puerto Rico.'
