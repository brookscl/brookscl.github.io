excerpt: 'Check out Chris Farrell''s article on ASL pros and cons.Â My favorite quote:  ...I
  think an unhealthy percentage of the skill involved in playing ASL is in simply
  knowing the rules. Is this really what you got into gaming for? Every time you play,
  you''re likely to discover a rule you''ve never seen before, or at least can''t
  remember ever seeing before. Ken and I gave ASL another shot last year and I finally
  decided to let go and stick to lighter wargames and German style games.'
