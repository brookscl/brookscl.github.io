excerpt: 'Amazon currently has some good deals on a few Mayfair games, particularly
  the crayon rail games.  There were a few that had been on my list, so at 50% off
  they were impossible to resist.  Just purchased:  Empire Builder [Amazon link] Silverton
  [Amazon link] Iron Dragon [Amazon link]'
