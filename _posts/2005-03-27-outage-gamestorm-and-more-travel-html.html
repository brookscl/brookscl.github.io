excerpt: Sorry about the outage today.  Sometimes with dasBlog (my weblog software)
  a big clump of entry files will show up with zero content and a weird datestamp,
  causing the engine to fail (though quite gracefully) to render my pages.  Fixed
  now. Jacob and I returned from GameStorm (all of 30 minutes from our house) about
  6pm tonight.  Didn't get much sleep over the weekend, so I'm tired and will not
  write anything up tonight.  I'm off for some more business travel tomorrow night
  but hope to get things written up tomorrow night.
