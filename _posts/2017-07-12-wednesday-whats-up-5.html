<h3 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tim.blog/2017/07/06/tao-of-seneca/">Tao of Seneca – Free PDFs</a> – This is more of a pointer if you want to get a taste of what the stoic thing is all about.</li>
<li>Finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2ub8MT9">Think Python</a> and I didn’t think it was very good. I wouldn’t use it for a CS class. There are better intro books and I’ll try to mention some later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/06/jeff-tweedy-together-at-last-review.html">Jeff Tweedy - Together at Last</a> – Yes, <a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2008/08/25/wilco-in-bend-html/">I’m a Tweedy fanboy going back to the 80s</a> so I’ll always listen to his new stuff. I love his acoustic sets because I can pick apart his songs and find new ways to play them on the guitar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/06/534316420/first-listen-offa-rex-the-queen-of-hearts">First Listen: Offa Rex, ‘The Queen of Hearts’</a> – Thought I’d like this more with The Decemberists involved, but alas no.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h3>
<ul>
<li>I like programming again
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2017/06/22/how-you-can-make-serious-money-by-learning-to-code-on-vacation/">How You Can Make Serious Money By Learning To Code On Vacation</a> – Is this the developer of tomorrow?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2017/06/16/79-websites-to-get-freelance-jobs-fast/">79 Websites To Get Freelance Jobs Fast</a> – They went scrounging for this article and I can tell you some of the sites they point to are unlikely to help you find a job. I’m not even sure they are all active. Still, I’m doing some deep diving here to learn more about this economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://qz.com/1019928/i-went-from-sedentary-academic-to-100-mile-marathon-runner-thanks-to-the-science-of-self-control/">I went from sedentary academic to 100-mile marathon runner—thanks to the science of self-control</a> – I didn’t see a lot of science discussed in this article, other than “self discipline means you can run 100 miles!”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/URLsAreUI.aspx">URLs are UI</a> – I haven’t always done a good job maintaining good URLs but I care about them and make attempts to preserve when I can. Most sites do not. Just go scroll through some of my old posts and follow the links - I bet only 10% work. Even some to my own site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/opinion/the-golden-age-of-bailing.html">The Golden Age of Bailing</a> – I’ve noticed this, have you?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/929/great-dalmuti">The Great Dalmuti</a> – One my all time favorite large-group games that isn’t a party game. Plus you get to wear funny hats.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu">Tichu</a> – The next step up from The Great Dalmuti is… Tichu! Always love this partner game and I was able to introduce two new people in a late-night game with Matthew.</li>
<li>Played the classic <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan">Catan</a> with Geoff and Mike. I don’t love this game but will always play it. Always seems to be a slog, even when I’m winning.</li>
<li>I introduced Geoff to the 2-player<a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small">Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small</a> and he enjoyed it. I love this quick-playing farm game.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6688/ninety-nine">Ninety-Nine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks">No Thanks!</a> – good even with four players.</li>
</ul>
