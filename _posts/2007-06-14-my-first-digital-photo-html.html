excerpt: 'I''m 99% certain that this is the first digital photograph I ever took. 
  Back in April 1997 I purchased an Epson PhotoPC 500 for a tidy sum (I bet you can
  buy a decent DSLR body for the same amount today!) and tried it out with some shots
  of Jacob at age 2.  Hard to believe I''ve been taking digital shots for over 10
  years now.  '
