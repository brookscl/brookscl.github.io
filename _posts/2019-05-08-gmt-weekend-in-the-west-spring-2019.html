<p>Julie and I worked out our return from our long hiking and backpacking trip to pass through central California so that I could (again) attend the <a href="https://www.gmtgames.com/">GMT Games </a>weekend at the warehouse event. Despite the very high heat it was a fun weekend with several new-to-me games played. And I bought a couple of games during the attendee special sale on Saturday.</p>
<p>My first game was <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/730/breakout-normandy">Breakout Normandy</a> with Steve. I played the Germans while my experienced opponent took the Allies, which I think would have been rougher for me to try on a first play. I got schooled in a fun way, losing Carentan was the final straw. Steve is working on a modern war version of the same system set in Iraq and I'm hopping to play test soon.</p>

<p>On Friday Steve played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/260465/across-narva-soviet-assault-estonia-february-1944">Across the Narva</a>, a chit-pull game at in the late east front of WWII.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/05/img_2854.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-2890" width="1000" height="750" /></p>
<p>Allen and others played a four played a cooperative game of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22877/fields-fire">Fields of Fire</a>. I'm so conflicted by this game, having played twice but always reluctant to bring it out as it seems more like <em>work</em> than fun.</p>

<p>After an early morning game of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21050/combat-commander-europe">Combat Commander: Europe</a> (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/86957/combat-commander-resistance">Resistance</a>) I spent the rest of Friday playing <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18748/unhappy-king-charles">Unhappy King Charles</a> with Tim. This was an eight hour game resulting in another loss for me, but Tim was very patient in teaching and I held my own until the final year.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/05/img_2860.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-2892" width="1000" height="750" /></p>
<p>A surprise hit for me was <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/239262/platoon-commander-deluxe-battle-kursk">The Battle of Kursk</a>, a game in Mark Walker's Platoon Commander series.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/05/img_2859.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-2893" width="750" height="1000" /></p>
<p>Very nice components in this game and just a few minor rules issues. I have a magazine game in this series (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187431/poland-strikes">Poland Strikes</a>!) that I'm bringing with me to Keuka Lake this summer.</p>

<p>Gene have his "state of GMT" talk on Saturday morning and company affairs seem to still be on a solid foundation.</p>
<p>What two games did I get? <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/214029/spacecorp">SpaceCorp</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159692/comancheria-rise-and-fall-comanche-empire">Comancher√≠a</a>.</p>
