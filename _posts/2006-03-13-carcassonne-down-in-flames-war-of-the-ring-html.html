excerpt: Last weekend presented a solid mixed bag of gaming, including two more check-marks
  off my unplayed list. Matthew had a birthday party to attend on Sunday afternoon
  for one of his fellow classmates and chess team members.  As of Friday afternoon
  we hadn’t yet chosen a present, so Julie asked me to pick up something from Rainy
  Day Games on the way home from work.  I had a few choices in mind (Pickomino, some
  lighter card games) but decided to pick up my favorite “simple” Carcassone game
  – Hunters and Gatherers.  The city is my favorite in the series, but a bit much
  for new gamers to learn from the box.  Matthew and I figured we better play it again
  so that Matthew could teach his friend how to play. The game wasn’t very close –
  Matthew was pretty tired by the time we started Friday night and I had to remind
  him of the rules a few times – he had the hardest time scoring the fishermen. Saturday
  evening Jacob and I broke out my copy of Zero!, volume 3 in the Down in Flames series. 
  I picked this up along with Corsairs and Hellcats in a GMT sale a year or two ago. 
  This is a card-driven WWII air combat game that feels a lot like a CCG without the
  collecting.  We played a simple element (figher & wingman) vs. element dogfight
  to get a feel for the rules.  There’s a lot more in the box than just the cards
  for the air combat, including bombers and a well packaged campaign game covering
  the early part of the Pacific war (Corsairs and Hellcats covering the later part).  The
  game was very easy to learn and Jacob (playing Japan) managed to shoot me down without
  taking any damage.  I just couldn’t get into any sort of advantaged position, and
  it seems to be tought to come from behind once you start to lose it.  I suspect
  the game is much more interesting with multiple elements where other pilots can
  come to the aid of one in danger and force an attacker to back off.  Jacob had a
  great time and looked very interested in trying the campaign game. Sunday morning
  we all ran in the Shamrock Run in downtown Portland.  Julie and I were signed up
  for the 8k, the boys the 5k, but once we looked at the race schedule we decided
  to all do the 5k rather than keep the boys waiting for an hour after they finished. 
  Jacob and I planned to play a full game of War of the Ring that afternoon, but I
  got a call from Ken late morning and we agreed to play.  That allowed Jacob and
  Brandon to play some XBox 360 and PC games. I had the game setup by late morning. 
  Ken arrived around 1:45 and we started our game at 2:15, with Ken playing the Free
  Peoples and me playing the Shadow Armies.  Like any game of this depth and complexity,
  things were a bit slow at the start as we worked out the rules.  Of particular help
  was a player aid / turn summary from BGG – I strongly recommend using this one for
  each player as it is much better than the aids that come with the game.  This is
  a very well designed game – I’m anxious enough to play it again that I’m willing
  to defer playing some other big games on my list for a few more chances to play
  it while the rules are still fresh in my head. We both fumbled around quite a bit
  with strategy as the choices often are pretty non-obvious.  It also hurt not knowing
  what the cards had to offer (we didn’t even scan them ahead of time).  Ken managed
  to kill of Saruman within 2 turns of his entry into the game, and I managed to steal
  6 VPs from strongholds that he left unoccupied.  The tension was great as I moved
  to 9 VPs (needing just one more to win), with Ken at 2 VPs (needing 2 more for a
  military victory), and the fellowship on the doorstep of Mordor. This is where I
  made a critical mistake, leaving Moria unoccupied as I raced up to Rivendell to
  capture the stronghold.  I even had a chance to muster a unit into there, instead
  opting for a Nazgul (useless by himself) and counting on another muster the following
  turn.  Well, I rolled three “eyes” and three “palantirs” on my next roll, and had
  no way to get any troops into Moria. Ken got the movement dice he needed and proceeded
  to walk into Moria unmolested, resulting in a military victory for the good guys. 
  I ended with 8 VPs.  Overall one of the best gaming experiences in recent memory
  – I’m glad I finally took the time to get this one played.
