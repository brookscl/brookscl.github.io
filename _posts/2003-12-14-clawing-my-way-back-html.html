excerpt: Thanks to my pack-rat friend Greg, I'm in the process of restoring most of
  my content.  Things will still be shakey for a while as my ISP stabilizes the environment. 
  I have a backlog of content to publish as well, including a glorious day of gaming
  yesterday where we had about 19 people at our home.
