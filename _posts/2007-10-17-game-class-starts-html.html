excerpt: " Class started today without a hitch.  I opted for Walk the Dogs to keep
  the first day simple and play something known by about half the class (returning
  from last year).  Next week I think we'll try Tsuro.   Side note - this picture
  was taken with the iPhone and emailed directly to my Flickr stream - pretty sweet
  functionality."
