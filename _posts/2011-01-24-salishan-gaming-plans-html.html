<p>I like to host an annual gaming event at our Salishan beach house but had to skip last year after starting a new job.  The <a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2008/12/22/salishan-gaming-2008.html">last event was in December 2008</a> and I'm thrilled to have my next one coming up this weekend.  The crowd will be a bit smaller than usual, but that's no problem as we have good numbers (7-9 depending on the day) for a wide range of games.  KC and Rita are driving out with me Thursday late afternoon and should get some lighter 3 player gaming in that first night.</p>
<p>Our gaming appetites are usually bigger than we can usually digest in a weekend.  We have a <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/63475/salishan-2011-games-to-play">geeklist over at BGG</a> to track the games we want to play and coordinate the "big slots" for the meatier games.  I'll be thrilled if I get to play the new <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77130/sid-meiers-civilization-the-board-game">Civilization</a> game and <em>finally</em> get around to playing <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12891/friedrich">Friedrich</a>.</p>
<p>I also need to squeeze in a six mile run - Julie and I are running a 10k on Superbowl Sunday and I don't want to miss a week.</p>
