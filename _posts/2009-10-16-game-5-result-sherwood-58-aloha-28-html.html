<p>We continued our unbeaten streak last Saturday vs Aloha Gold in a game that felt much closer than the final score. Aloha brought a very strong passing attack to the game that exposed some weaknesses in our usual staunch defense. Aloha passed for 284 yards on mostly long passes and we had some significant breakdowns in secondary pass coverage. Needless to say this was a key focus during the week - a great opportunity for the kids to learn and get pushed a bit.</p>
<p>Our offense continued its dominance with 9 touchdowns on 9 drives - no turnovers, no punts, no turnover on downs. It doesn't hurt having an elite back, but teams have learned that they can't just focus on a single running back. We had five other backs with total yardage of at least 25 yards in the game.</p>

<p>We spent the week putting in a new defensive formation to help with stopping an inside running game and a wedge-oriented offense as well as adding a new safety blitz. Most of our time was spent on some new offensive plays and formations that we will gradually roll out over our final three regular season games. These games are also a chance for us to get as many kids involved in the offense carrying the ball as possible. We especially work hard to get kids touchdown opportunities.</p>
<p>Saturday we play Liberty JV at Sherwood High School, 5pm. Looks like rain is in store for us so we'll work hard a balanced inside and outside running game.</p>
