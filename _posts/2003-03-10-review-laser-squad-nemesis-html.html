excerpt: Odds are, you haven't heard of this game.  You  won't find it on the shelves
  of your local retailer and you won't see see 16  year olds lugging it to LAN parties
  for death matches.  Laser Squad Nemesis is a turn-based,  tactical, squad-oriented
  game played via email.  It has a real-time feel to  it though - this isn't like
  most hex-oriented turn-based war games. The game is very light weight and approachable. 
  The client is free to  download and you can get started quickly with the tutorials. 
  In a LSN game  you are pitted against a single opponent - each can play one of four
  races  (Marines, Machina, Spawn, or Greys).  There are a variety of maps to choose  from
  and a flexible map editor is included with the game. Once you have tried the tutorials,
  you can play up to three games against a  real opponent before paying for a subscription,
  though you are limited to  playing the Marines on just a few maps.  This try before
  you buy philosophy  is very attractive, and subscriptions are low-risk if you want
  to get your feet  wet playing the full game ($7 for 1 month, $15 for 3 months).
  A Laser Squad game begins with force deployment - each player has a number of  force
  points and an area on the map on which they can deploy their forces.   This is a
  key strategic element to the game - which units to use, where to  deploy them -
  decision based on both the map and the race of your opponent. Gameplay involves
  controlling individual units in an attempt to either wipe  out the opponents units
  or destroy the opponent's headquarters.  The  central LSN server resolves each turn
  and emails the turn results to each  player.  I won't go into strategy here (you
  wouldn't to follow my advice  any way - I'm still a rank amateur), but there are
  great guides published and a continuous  stream of community participation.  The
  masterpiece of strategy guides is  the Grenadier's  Bible. I've had no problems
  finding random opponents and recruiting friends - this  community has critical mass
  and the game is here to stay.  If you are a fan  of X-COM, Squad  Leader, or would
  just like a break from the frenetic pace of RTS or FPS, try  this game.
