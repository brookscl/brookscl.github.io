excerpt: 'Now for something a bit different.  Using the great Microsoft Photo Story
  3 tools I created a narrated slideshow / video of the Salishan home.  There are
  low-res and high-res versions available for download and viewing.  Salishan (low-res
  - 1.56 MB)  Salishan (hi-res - 6MB) Update: You probably need to download the latest
  Windows Media Player to view these.  If you aren''t on Windows, well, you probably
  can''t see them at all.  Sorry.'
