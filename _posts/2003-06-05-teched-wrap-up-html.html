excerpt: "              TechEd is essentially over for me - I'll be driving to the
  airport tomorrow morning         and should be home by around noon. It was a good
  week - though only about half of         the presentations I attended met my expectations. 
  I was able to use the week         to write some long overdue white papers on integrating
  .NET into the Corillian         Voyager platform, as well as play with some message-based
  concept code I've been         working on with our chief architects, Scott         Hanselman
  and Bradley McLain.  Clemens'         talk on AOP cemented many concepts I've been
  thinking about incorporating, particularly         relating to session management
  and audit logging.  If only this stuff was baked         into the .NET framework
  today.                                                                      The
  \                    highlight of the show for me was Scott Hanselman's presentation
  (that's Scott on the                     left schmoozing the crowd before his talk):
  Learning                     to Love WSDL.  Granted I'm a bit biased, but damn he's
  good at this.                      He has a way of blending humor and personal stories
  with great content.                                                                                   
  \                                                               On                     a
  much lighter note, I ran into Scott Ladewig (that's Scott on the right, I'm on the
  \                    left), a college roommate and old friend (well, he's young,
  but we've been friends                     for around 17 years I suppose).  Scott
  manages the IT infrastructure at the Washington                     University School
  of Business.                      Scott and I lived in the same dorm freshman year,
  then shared a suite our sophomore                     year. Scott was a ChemE and
  one of the smartest engineering students I knew at Wash                     U. 
  He worked for Exxon for a while, but decided he liked computers more so went                     back
  to WashU for a couple of graduate degrees and ended up working there.  I                     was
  absolutely floored when I ran into him at the show, and I'm glad we got some time
  \                    together.                                                                 
  \                                                               Scott                     and
  I wrapped up the evening at the closing TechEd party, featuring Smashmouth and                     the
  Wallflowers.  The Wallflowers were amazing - I've been a fan since their                     first
  album and they didn't disappoint.  Great way to end the week.
