excerpt: A while back I raised the quandry “should I get a Digital Rebel”.  Well,
  about a week ago Julie and I took the dive and we are starting to get some nice
  results.  I spent some time Sunday morning playing with the automatic and manual
  settings - this camera operates just like the old Eos Elan but much better.  Of
  course the amazing part is the instant feedback from settings to a viewable image
  - a much better way to learn and adapt.         This was taken with the zoom lens.
