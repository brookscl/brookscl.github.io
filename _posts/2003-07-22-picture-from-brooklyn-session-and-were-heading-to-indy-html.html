excerpt: 'I promised to post a photo or two from my session in Brooklyn last month. 
  Here''s a photo of Mikael, Lev, and Jonathan (left to right) during our game of
  Wallenstein.  As I mentioned before, I loved this game and I recently placed an
  order at Funagain.  It is on backorder and I should see it sometime in August. 
  I also picked up Serenissima (haven''t played yet) and Capt''n Clever (played with
  the boys last weekend - very light but a good bit of fun).          Mikael, Lev,
  and Jonathan in my first ever play of Wallenstein. Julie, Jacob, Matthew, and I
  fly to Indianapolis tomorrow for a combined family visit and trek to GenCon.  My
  parents and sister live there, and Julie''s grandmother is up in West Lafayette
  (she turns 90 next month).  Jacob and I will spend Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
  at GenCon, and I''ll probably bring Matthew for a half day on Friday.  I''ll try
  and post some daily reports of our adventures there. '
