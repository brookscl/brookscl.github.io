excerpt: 'It had been far too long since we had been family camping, so back in January
  Julie and I decided to book some time in a Yurt in one of the Oregon State Parks. 
  Ever the crafty planner, I chose the Bandon area knowing that I could probably squeeze
  in 18 holes of golf at one of the world reknowned courses at Bandon Dunes.  Bullards
  Beach is about as convenient to Bandon Dunes as you can get without staying at the
  resort, so we stayed there (great article on Bullards Beach here).  Yurts in Oregon are
  ideal for off-season camping.  Weather on the Oregon coast is unpredictable at best,
  and for extended camping (we went for four nights) a tent can turn into a somewhat
  miserable experience when dealing with high winds, sleet, and hail.  All of the
  cooking is still down outdoors and you can experience campfires, hiking, etc. Bandon
  is a bit of a long drive from Portland - around 4 hours or so.  We weren''t in a
  hurry leaving Saturday and departed around 11am, stopping for lunch in Albany. 
  This was my first experience locating a restaurant with my new Blackberry 8800 /
  GPS / TeleNav and it worked like a charm, finding us a cozy Mexican restaurant with
  outstanding service.  On Sunday we visited the West Coast Game Park, a smallish
  zoo with an expansive petting area that exceeded our expectations.  I don''t think
  I''ve ever seen a better big cat exhibit - they had three lions, 3-4 tigers, 5-6
  black panthers, and other assorted smaller cats.  Matthew is in heaven when he can
  get up close and pet the animals and had a blast directing the deer herd.   On Sunday
  afternoon we took a horseback ride on the beaches south of Bandon.  This was probably
  the highlight of the entire trip for all of us - beautiful horses, beautiful scenery,
  and an excellent guide resulted in a ride to remember.  My horse was the most eager
  of the bunch and was always quick to trot and race ahead, an event that Jacob and
  Matthew always anticipated as their horses would often accelerate to keep up with
  me.  Monday morning brought my golfing adventure and an early 8:30am tee time at
  Bandon Dunes.  The weather started off spectacularly clear but cool, but after four
  holes things went sideways quickly.  Literally: the winds picked up to 25-30 mph
  and the hail and sleet came in.  This lasted about 3 holes and I was very thankful
  to have good raingear handy (a must for Oregon golfing).  My caddy was excellent,
  and I recommend getting one for your first visit to the course unless you are there
  with experienced Bandon golfers.  He really helped me through a few of the holes
  and had me putting from off the green whenever I had a clear line to the whole and
  was within 15 yards of the fringe.  I stayed within myself and shot an 89, not bad
  for my first time on the course with some bad weather.  We ate entirely too well
  on the trip, trying out many new dutch oven recipes that I suspect will start turning
  up on Jacob''s menus with his patrol in Boy Scouts.  The menu included fresh baked
  biscuits and sausage gravy, Mexican casserole, homemade beef stew, and cherry dump
  cake.  The trip closed out with a driving tour south of Bandon.  I would have liked
  to have made it all the way to Gold Beach, but the rest of the family wasn''t too
  keen to spend that much time in the car.  We hit some fabulously intense weather
  along the way, getting gusts in the 50mph range when stopping to check out another
  lighthouse.'
