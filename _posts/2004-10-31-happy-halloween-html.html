excerpt: For your viewing pleasure, here are a few costume photos from the weekend. 
  Julie and I are big fans of Shaun of the Dead in case you don't know what you are
  looking at.         Julie definitely did the most work here - don't miss the album
  protruding from her belly. Bonus points if you guess the album I'm holding.         Jacob
  and Matthew were able to pull it off as well.  Jacob wouldn't let me paint a beard
  on his face though.
