excerpt: " Football season for Jacob and Matthew ended this Saturday as Jacob’s team
  lost in their championship bid against a tough Canby team 6–0.  The only touchdown
  was a defensive score off of a fumble – this was a tough defensive battle!  Jacob
  did a great job this year on the line, playing offensive center and tackle and a
  number of different line positions on defense.  Matthew also had a great year, playing
  fullback and scoring over five touchdowns and putting in some great play at cornerback. 
  He’ll be playing again at the same level next year so should be a dominant force
  at running back."
