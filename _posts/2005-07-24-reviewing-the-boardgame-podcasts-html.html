excerpt: I somewhat reluctantly started listening to Podcasts about a month or two
  ago.  I say reluctantly because initially I didn’t really see the point of downloading
  amateurish audio content, plus the mechanics of listening in the “early days” (5–6
  months ago) were a bit of a pain.  I did listen to the first 6 GeekSpeak episodes
  last year on my PC but dropped out for several months.  This June I took the time
  to wire up iTunes and my iPod to a few Podcasts using the fantastic iPodder software
  and subscribed to the trifecta of GeekSpeak, BoardGames To Go, and The Dice Tower. 
  They are now regular commute listening for me, and Jacob has even been requesting
  Geek Speak when we drive out to the coast.   I’ve listened to each enough to write
  some commentary, so here goes.    As far as boardgame oriented Podcasts go, this
  is the one that started it all.  Derk and Aldie (Aldie and Derk?) continue to innovate
  with BoardGameGeek and GeekSpeak sets the benchmark by which the others will be
  measured.  This show has the A-list guests and the shows continue to improve.  Some
  highlights include Mike Fitzgerald, Peter Sarrett, and Guido Teuber.  I’m less fond
  of some of the interludes in the show – the Origins reporting by Ted Cheatham was
  painful and the audio quality of Aldie’s soundseeing tour of the Gathering was poor. 
  When they stick to their core, which is interviewing notable guests.  This podcast
  also happens to be Jacob’s favorite, mostly because of Derk’s antics. Maybe it would
  hurt the chemistry, but at times I do wish Derk would tone down the sarcastic digs
  against his guests (and Reiner).  I guess I expect more respect for the guests –
  a few pokes now and then are fine but keep it professional.  Think of GeekSpeak
  as the Daily Show of boardgame Podcasts.    Mark Johnson has maintained a popular
  weblog for some time and recently started producing a Podcast on boardgames.  Mark’s
  Podcast is more of a solo effort and has a keen focus on reviews, session reports,
  and special topics of interest to Mark.  Mark is also experimenting with including
  his kids on Podcasts – I think this is a great idea when done in moderation.  It
  is difficult enough for the run-of-the-mill amateur Podcaster to maintain a level
  of quality to keep audience interest; with kids on the show I think the challenge
  is even greater.  Mark is at his best when he covers special topics, and his intro
  shows (Intro to Podcasting and Intro to Boardgames) are top notch.  I particularly
  like Mark’s humility (Derk could use a bit more of this ) and willingness to listen
  to listener feedback and adjust accordingly.  Think of Mark and Boardgames To Go
  as the the Jim Lehrer of Podcasts.  A bit dry at times, but solid content worth
  tuning into.  The Dice Tower is the brainchild and production of Tom Vasel and Joe
  Steadman. For entertainment value, The Dice Tower sits right in between GeekSpeak
  and Boardgames To Go.  I appreciate that Tom and Joe aren’t trying to just be another
  Derk and Aldie – they’ve taken a unique approach to their shows, relying on banter
  and the push-pull of their different interests.  Tom prefers European-style boardgames
  while Joe is a grognard wargame enthusiast.  I particularly enjoy their top 10 lists
  (favorite publishers, favorite gateway games, etc.) as it is interesting hearing
  their different views and the ensuing dialog.  At times their banter becomes a bit
  too vitriolic for my tastes – I understand they are good friends and the jabs are
  probably good natured, but without knowing them (and seeing body language) the exchanges
  seem a bit over-the-top at times.  I suggest they tone down the conflict and keep
  it civil without losing the healthy debates that make the show entertaining.  Think
  of the Dice Tower as the Hannity and Colmes of boardgame Podcasts.   Well, that’s
  just one man’s opinion and I’ll keep listening to all three and hope to see even
  more (unique) Podcasts show up on the net.
