excerpt: We are nearing the end of basketball season for both boys (young men?). They've
  both progressed very well this year, and I've been able to spend a lot of time shooting
  games with various lenses (thanks to Pro Photo Supply rentals). Matthew is playing
  on the Sherwood 7th grade classic A team in the most-competitive Three Rivers 3A
  division. They are seeing some very tough competition this year, and Matthew at
  6' tall is finding himself looking up to other players in about half of their games.
  His team has several tall post players which has allowed him to play at least three
  different positions fairly regularly and helped further his development. The team
  isn't having quite the success they had last year, though they have won two tournaments
  and finished as runners-up in two others.  Jacob is enjoying his first year of high
  school (freshman) basketball and has truly surprised us with his development. He
  is regularly scoring in double digits and garnering similar numbers of rebounds.
  I think I've seen him take one shot outside of 8 feet all season, so everything
  is coming inside the paint and much of it through hard work on the offensive boards.
  He's developed a soft touch with a jump hook as well.  Unfortunately Jacob suffered
  a mild concussion after taking an elbow to the jaw last Friday night so he'll be
  out for this week at a minimum, and he may miss the rest of the season. This doesn't
  diminish the great progress he's made this year and I know he'll be back to play
  again next year.
