excerpt: I spent last weekend in Nashville at my good friend Russ Waitman's wedding. 
  Russ and I were roommates in college, sharing an engineering suite our sophomore
  year and an apartment offsite our junior year.  After college, we both ended up
  serving our active duty officer assignments in the US Air Force at Wright-Patterson
  AFB in Dayton, OH.  Russ entered the medical service working in hospital administration
  while I helped develop software for cockpit simulations at Wright Laboratory. Russ
  and I hadn't seen each other since I left the Air Force in 1996.  Russ went on to
  Vanderbilt to get his MS and PhD in Biomedical engineering, an amazing accomplishment. 
  We've stayed in touch over the phone and through email over the years, and I was
  thrilled to learn earlier this year that he was getting married.  I was also honored
  to stand with him as a groomsman.  On Saturday evening, Russ married Jessica Preston,
  a lovely, beautiful, and clearly intelligent woman that he met at school.  They
  are away on honeymoon right now in the Pacific northwest enjoying their first week
  of married life. I took a few photos during my stay there, so here goes.         Hatch
  Show Print is a still in operation letterpress print famous for their posters promoting
  country music concerts in Nashville.         On Friday evening I ventured downtown
  to some of the country bars to hear some live music.  Highlight of the evening was
  the rockabilly band Twistin Tarantulas.         On Saturday morning before the wedding,
  I spent some time at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.  Highly recommended
  - more on that later.         Russ and I just before the wedding.         The beautiful
  bridal party.         Russ and the other groomsman.  We're all engineers; funny
  that.  At the reception we preceded our toast with a telling of the top 10 reasons
  to marry an engineer.
