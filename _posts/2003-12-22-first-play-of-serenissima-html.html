excerpt: 'This game sat on my shelf too long - in fact, it was the only "big box"
  game remaining in my game closet that I had yet to play. I know, compared to many
  that isn''t a bad track record - I''ve seen a number of game collections with 10
  or more games still in shrink wrap.  Still, I''m a gamer not a collector and I want
  to play what I have.  Ken Rude and I arranged a late evening during the week where
  we could get together to try this one out.  Brandon, Ken''s son, joined us for a
  three player game. Serenissima is not a new game - it was released in 1996.  I picked
  up because, well, I''m still a wargamer at heart and I find it hard to resist games
  that can be played in a single sitting but still harken back to the days of youth
  playing Avalon Hill war games.  That''s why Wallenstein is at the top of my list
  of games right now. This is not exactly a wargame though - economy is at least as
  important, and it is through the trading and shipping of goods that money and ultimately
  victory points are earned. Each player takes on the role of one of the great nation-states
  on the Mediterranean - Venice, Genoa, Turkey, or Spain.  In a three-player game,
  Turkey is not played.  Each player starts with 2000 ducats, 10 sailors, and two
  galleys.  Each turn starts with bids to determine player order.  This turn order
  is used within each of the turn phases, which are:  Buy trade goods, build ships
  and fortresses, hire sailors  Movement  Combat  Capture and control ports  Sell
  goods and generate income The goal is to control shipping ports and to fully populate
  their warehouses with a diversity of trade goods (there are 7 in all).  There are
  three kinds of ports - large (6 goods in the warehouse), medium (4), and small (2). 
  Players score 10 points for each large town with a filled warehouse, 5 points for
  each medium town with a filled warehouse, and 2 points for each small town with
  a filled warehouse.  Towns with unfilled warehouses score 1 point each, and if you
  control your main city you score 10 points. Combat between ships or from ship to
  port is a function of the number of sailors on each side.  In ship to ship combat,
  each player attacks simultaneously and rolls a d6, adding the number of sailors
  on the galley to the roll.  Divide the result by 3 and round down, and that is the
  number of sailors on the opposing galley that are sunk.  It is possible to capture
  opponents'' galleys if you eliminate their sailors and have enough of your own to
  move over and capture (each galley must have at least 1 sailor). Within each galley
  there are five holding slots, and these can be filled with any combination of sailors
  or trade goods as long as there is at least 1 sailor and no more than five total
  items on the galley.  A ship''s movement range is equivalent to the number of sailors. 
  So it is clearly an advantage in both movement and combat to have more sailors on
  board; however, this will limit the number of trade goods that you can carry around. 
  You can check out the complete rules right here.        Brandon and Ken examine
  the Serenissima game board. Ken played Genoa, Brandon was Spain, and I played Venice. 
  Things started off nice a peaceful - I expanded east into Turkey and was getting
  a decent diversity of goods.  Ken capitalized on some goods that Brandon had not
  yet traded yet in any of his ports by trading that good to his major town.  Twice
  he earned a 1000 ducat bonus for these trades!  While it helped brandon populate
  his major town with goods, this was clearly a good move for Ken since it allowed
  him to quickly get an advantage in both ships and sailors. As so often happens in
  three player games, the first to get aggressive often pays dearly.  I decided to
  attack an ill-defended port of Ken''s (I believe it was one of his gold ports) and
  successfully capture it.  Unfortunately it brought on his wrath and not only did
  I lose that port back to him the next turn, I also lost two ships in the vicinity.
  Ken played very well - he intuitively figured out (I suspect now that this is a
  common game strategy) to diversify his fleet by keeping some trade ships around
  with few sailors (usually 2) while building a separate fleet of combat ships with
  5 sailors each.  These ships, with their extensive range, were able to wreak havoc
  on my ships and ports.  We decided to cut the game a bit short (I think we played
  only 8 turns instead of 10), and though I did a pretty good job of holding off his
  final attack, he did manage to take a port away from me at the end.  It didn''t
  matter much though - Ken had filled a good portion of his medium ports (because
  of the shortened game, nobody got a completed large port) and beat us handily. 
  I don''t have the final scores in front of me, but Ken beat me by at least 10 points,
  with Brandon finishing behind me by about 10 points. Fun game - I suspect it can
  be played in 2-3 hours and I look forward to playing it again.  One criticism of
  the game is that it often follows the same pattern - trade or the first 2/3 of the
  game, then just start hammering the opponents by attacking.  Ours certainly played
  out the same way.        Final configuration.'
