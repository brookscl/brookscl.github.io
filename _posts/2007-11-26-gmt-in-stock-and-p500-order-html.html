excerpt: " It sure is hard to resist GMT Games' annual in-stock discount.  After chatting
  with Mike Deans yesterday afternoon I placed my in-stock order, plus added a few
  P500 reprints to my list after hoping they too were in stock.  What I really wanted
  to just buy was Ardennes '44 and Wilderness War, but alas they are out of print
  so I went ahead and P500'd them.  They both appear to be a long ways from a reprint.
  \ So what to order at 50% off?  I opted for Downtown and For the People.  Downtown
  covers a theater I've never played before (Vietname) and For the People is a well
  regarded (by most) card-driven game."
