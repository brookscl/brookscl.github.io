excerpt: 'Baseball season is over! Both boys wrapped up their seasons last weekend
  by competing in the Junior Baseball of Oregon state championships.  Matthew''s team
  went undefeated during the regular season and finished fourth in the state at the
  Midget Federal level - a great accomplishment though we know they could easily have
  finished first in the state as they beat each of the teams that finished ahead of
  them at least twice during the season.  That''s why you play the games though!  Here
  are all of the photosets from Matthew''s season:      Memorial Day Tournament in
  Bend     Reedville Federal Tournament    vs. Westview    State Tournament             Jacob''s
  team had a great second half, surging in their league play to get a berth in the
  district tournament and qualifying for the state championship.  They also won the
  Newberg Junior Federal tournament.  Here are all of the photosets from Jacob''s
  season:    Memorial Day Tournament in Bend     Reedville Junior Federal Tournament     vs.
  Westview    Newberg Junior Federal Tournament     '
