excerpt: Julie, Jacob, Matthew and I spent the weekend in La Pine, Oregon, located
  in central Oregon just south of Sun River.  Jacob had a busy weekend of baseball
  scheduled (5 games over 3 days).  Many of our friends opted for houses or condos
  in Sun River or Bend, but we decided to stay right in La Pine to (1) experience
  a new town (2) get an indoor pool and (3) minimize the driving to/from the games. 
  Here's a short photo journal of our weekend.         Jacob's first game on Saturday
  wasn't until 2pm, so after a dip in the pool we played a 4-way game of San Juan. 
  This was the closest game I've played in so far - Jacob, Julie, and I each finished
  with 35 points.  There is usually opportunities for second-guessing of choices in
  this game, and this was no exception.  I held on to one to many cards one round
  when I could have tucked one away in the Chapel - of course that cost me the one
  point that would have led to victory.  Jacob won by the tiebreaker, continuing his
  unbeaten streak.         Matthew is usually the true hero of events like this -
  he spends most of the time trying to keep himself busy while his big brother plays
  game after game.  His time will come soon for tournaments like this, possibly as
  soon as next year.         Not that he didn't find any time to play and occupy himself. 
  A good part of Saturday afternoon was spent playing with some of the cute sisters
  of Jacob's teammates.         Jacob's coaching staff is simply wonderful.  Coach
  Dyer (left) has a great sense of humor and is a master at reducing tension and making
  the boys feel comfortable.         Jacob's catching abilities are really coming
  along.  One key as a catcher is to get a quick release when throwing out baserunners
  - this means minimizing steps and snapping your throw.  At the start of the season
  Jacob would often take two steps before throwing and would sometimes double-clutch. 
  Lately his release has become much quicker - now he needs to work on his arm strength
  and speed.         Sunday's games were over by early afternoon.  We drove about
  25 minutes to Newberry National Volcanic Monument to visit the Big Obsidian Flow. 
  This was well worth the trip - a huge flow of obsidian sits alongside volcanic rock,
  and this time of year also meant quite a bit of snow.         We ended the day on
  Sunday with a visit to Paulina Creek Falls, a nice little waterfall beneath Paulina
  lake. Jacob's team did very well, finishing 4-1 over the weekend with their only
  loss to one of the other strong Sherwood teams.  All of this pre-season tournament
  work appears to be paying off - they had their first regular season game tonight
  against an Aloha team and beat them 16-1.
