excerpt: 'Sorry for the late report on our last day at GenCon (Saturday).  This was
  an abbreviated day - had to make it back to Shelbyville in time for a birthday celebration
  with the family.  It was a blast nonetheless and I have a few more photos to share.          Jacob
  examines his order cards in Battle Cry. We started the day by checking out Battle
  Cry from Game Base 7.  This is a game I''ve been wanting to try for quite a long
  time, and I was not disappointed.  This is a very light, very tactical war game
  set during the American Civil War.  There''s a lot to like about this game: the
  use of command cards to simulate (in my opinion) the complexity and latency of issuing
  commands on the field; the use of multiple miniatures in a square to represent force
  strength; the easy to learn and execute combat system.  We taught ourselves the
  game and played the Bull Run scenario in about 45 minutes.  I won fairly easily,
  but I was playing the confederates and for some reason I think the deck is stacked
  against the union in this scenario.  This is definitely a game we''ll add to our
  collection.          Jacob and I enjoy a game of Elfenland.  Our next game was a
  scheduled event to play Elfenland.  I''ve played King of the Elves many times with
  my kids, but this was our first chance playing the board game.  We both enjoyed
  the board game more than the card game.  Players attempt to visit as many towns
  as possible in the space of 4 turns.  Player interaction comes in a few interesting
  ways.  Players alternate choosing what mode of transportation will be used to travel
  from town to town.  By leveraging routes laid out by other players, a player can
  likely visit more towns in a turn.  But with that approach comes risk, since a player
  might subsequently choose an unusable mode of transportation to a town you plan
  to visit.  I didn''t catch on soon enough, and my initial path sent me too far away
  from the other players, limiting my travel each turn.  I''ll still managed to finish
  in second place with 17 towns visited to the winner''s 18.         Jacob and I had
  a fab time playing some D&D in this RPGA sessions. The last event of GenCon for
  Jacob and me was a 4 hour RPGA-sponsored Dungeons and Dragons adventure - part of
  the Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.  We fell in with a great group and had
  a fun time, even though we did not manage to complete the adventure.  Jacob played
  a shield dwarf fighter and I played a human rouge - the rest of the party were either
  elves or half-elves.  This was the highlight of the convention for Jacob - he loves
  role playing and looked forward to this event all week. That''s all for GenCon Indy
  2003!  We plan to make it back each year given the proximity to family in the Indianapolis
  area. '
