<p>We started our Thursday with a pre-sunset arrival at the Devil’s Garden parking area for breakfast and coffee. This would be a longer hike and we wanted to experience it in the cool morning air. There were maybe 10 other intrepid souls ready to do the same. </p>
<p>The arch you see is Landscape Arch, one of the longer arches in the park. The shot of Julie and me is on an amazing stone fin we walked out on, probably the highlight of this hike. We’ve taken to doing some workout and P.T. on the hikes. </p>
<p>This was about 8.5 miles all in, including the side trails.</p>
