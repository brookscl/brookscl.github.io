excerpt: 'Convention Summary  BGG.CON 2007 was quite a bit different than 2005, the
  last time I attended.  In 2005 and 2006 the convention was held in downtown Dallas
  at the Westin with game rooms that were a bit more intimate.  The hotel was unnecessarily
  nice for a gamer crowd and expensive - I recall that the rooms were about $200-$230
  per night, and I didn''t have a roommate (though Sunriver Games picked up the tab). 
  The location was outstanding though, with many dining opportunities nearby via public
  transportation and walking.  There was a great inexpensive breakfast cafe adjacent
  to the hotel and we had some great side trips to an Irish pub and BBQ joint.  Still,
  the room rate was very expensive and likely would have constrained growth beyond
  the 200 or so people that came initially (note: my numbers may be way off, but I
  think they are close to accurate!).  The small crowd did give a very intimate feeling
  to the convention and I felt like I got to associate with a significant percentage
  of the attendees - this was a GOOD thing as the gamer crowd at BGG.CON is by and
  large a very well adjusted, easy to get along with crowd.  And none of them smell.
  The move to the airport Westin brought a number of tradeoffs - someone should design
  a game with a theme of running a game convention!  The room rate was very affordable
  - my share after splitting the room with Greg will be about $240 for four nights. 
  You''d be lucky to stay at a Best Western or Marriott Courtyard for that rate, and
  this hotel was very nice (I travel a small bit and have stayed at some very nice
  hotels across the world, and this is in the 3-4 star category on a 5 star scale). 
  The gaming space was first rate and handled the crowd size just fine.  At peak times
  (Saturday afternoon) it was a bit challenging finding good space, but I don''t think
  anybody had to resort to sitting on the ground to play which would be the first
  sign that space was running low.  Jim and I both agreed that the lack of dining
  options was a major issue that needs to be resolved.  There were two restaurant
  options in walking distance (we know this because we ran 4 miles one morning around
  the area, and Jim ran again Saturday for 5 miles): the hotel and Denny''s.  The
  Denny''s was as expected but too smoky, and while the hotel food was good it was
  very expensive and provided a limited menu.  We were fortunate to have local friends
  that drove us to Cajun food one night and BBQ another afternoon, but there''s no
  way that everyone had the same treatment.  In the balance I think this hotel was
  still a better call and will plan on returning next year - it was the best game
  convention experience I''ve ever had.  Here are a few suggestions for Aldie and
  crew to address the food issue next year:  Continue to search for other hotels in
  the DFW area that provide free airport transportation, sufficient ballroom space,
  reasonable room rates, and a small diversity of dining options in walking distance. 
  I think if there was a Red Robin or TGI Fridays or some similar option nearby the
  problem would be solved.  Keep it at the Westin, but hire a shuttle service to a
  strip mall or shopping center nearby during dinner hours to allow people a chance
  to get away without hiring a cab.  Increase the convention fee to cover the cost,
  or charge a $5 toll per person to use the service.  Don''t cater the food from the
  hotel.  I''ve dealt with this quite a bit over the years running small conferences
  at Corillian and the costs are high and the quality typically low.  Get people away
  from the hotel and they will be refreshed and get some local flavor. Aldie and crew
  (Vicky in particular) should know that my criticisms are on the fringes and I give
  the convention an A or A- rating as a whole.  For reference, I would give GenCon
  a B (A+ for show floor, C or open gaming), Origins a B (C+ for show floor, B for
  open gaming), and Essen a B+ (A+ for show floor, D for open gaming, and A- for local
  flair and dining).  Looking at 2008, BGG.CON may be the only convention I attend
  as I will unfortunately miss GameStorm (shame on them for scheduling over spring
  break!). Here''s a quick wrap-up on the games I played at BGG.CON.  I played 19
  games and won 10 of them, confirming what I''ve told Julie that I''m really good
  at figuring out new games on the fly but gravitate towards ineptitude as other players
  figure out what is going on. Games to Purchase (or Games I''m Thrilled I Already
  Purchased!) Brass - this was my one Essen order (thanks for picking this up Carey)
  and I''m thrilled I got it.  I''m a sucker for Warfrog / Wallace releases and this
  one didn''t disappoint and I put it in my top 3 Wallace games with Conquest of the
  Empire and Volldampf. Please don''t be put off by the criticisms that the rules
  are poor - I put the rules for this game in the upper 50 percentile and after one
  play through this deep game you''ll easily have it all figured out. Thebes - theme
  marries mechanics in this great lighter Euro that represents where game designers
  should move towards.  I''m so tired of poorly themed games that are really just
  abstract games in disguise - designers, spend time on finding a theme that fits
  the mechanics! Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage - my best gaming experience of the convention,
  and I think Jim had the same opinion.  There is a reason this game continues to
  sit at the top of many all-time best game lists, including BGG - this is an incredibly
  balanced, thematic, asymmetric blend of American war gaming and Euro mechanics that
  will get played a lot over the next few years, especially if I can convince Jacob
  to play it  Cuba - I''m on the fence here as I''m worried it won''t get played much,
  but I love the theme and bits and found the game to be very engaging. Agricola -
  The cards are the clincher for this game - Uwe could have left them out and had
  a decent farming / civ building game that would have been solid but not have made
  my list of must buy in the company of Through the Ages and Roads and Boats. The
  cards add a roleplaying element and solidify the theme in a way that will greatly
  increase replayability.  The true test will be playing with Jacob and Matthew and
  seeing if they both get it and enjoy it. Race for the Galaxy - This is the most
  obvious buy for me on the list of games I don''t already have, and I expect it to
  be played often over the next few years. I can pack this in my portable game bag
  (what do I take out?  Agora? San Juan?).   Games I Hope To Play Again But Will Not
  Purchase In the Year of the Dragon - This almost made the buy list, but I think
  someone else in the group will buy it and I doubt it would get played at home. 
  This is a very good game with very little downtime and a nice theme and a stream
  of difficult decisions. Hamburgum - Like Year of the Dragon, this may get purchased
  if nobody else in my group gets it.  This is a game I want to explore more and likely
  has a great deal of hidden depth given the lack of random elements in the game.
  Colosseum - I want to try this again when I''m not fighting a cold and sleep deprivation. 
  Jeff Deboer and Jim loved the game and maybe I can too, but the eye chart of show
  options threw me off and would likely make it unplayable with Matthew and Julie. 
  This is a surprise coming from Days of Wonder - I think they could have simplified
  the show production a bit more by reducing options or features and still had a very
  solid game. Mission: Red Planet - On the fence here as the short play time may push
  it to a purchase but the quality of components disappoints.  Fjords - A surprising
  hit, I would purchase this if I didn''t already have an amazing set of two player
  light games that rarely get played (Roma, Jambo, and Medici vs Strozzi for example).
  Hansa - This is just a 3 on the 1-4 scale - I''ll always play this if someone asks
  for it but would rarely suggest it myself. Louis XIV - Ditto with Hansa, but maybe
  I just need to play with some players that aren''t sharks.   Games I Don''t Expect
  To Play Again Before the Wind - Phalanx seems to be uneven in their production and
  translation quality, and I wish they had spent more time writing quality English
  rules for this otherwise decent game.  The reason I don''t expect to play it again
  is I doubt anyone in my group will buy it, but I would probably happily play it
  again if suggested. Oregon - No reason to play this again.  You know a game is flawed
  when you win my a big margin yet still walk away dissatisfied. I really hope Carey
  comes up with a good game design for codename "Mosquito Fleet" so that we get another
  great Northwest USA themed game (my current favorite of course being KC''s unpublished
  Northwest Trek).   Games I Wish I Had Tried Starcraft: the Boardgame - we still
  play Starcraft multi-player at home 7-8 years after its initial release.  Easily
  in my top 5 computer games of all times, this is the perfect theme to be played
  at home with Jacob and Matthew.  Then again, so is Warcraft: the Boardgame and it
  rarely gets played now.  Given the price point and weight of this game, I want to
  try before I buy and I regret not fitting this in.  I''m hard pressed to identify
  what I shouldn''t have played to fit this in. Amyitis - the latest Ystari release,
  I have a habit of ignoring these for some reason then being pleasantly surprised
  with the quality (namely Ys and Yspahan, though I grabbed Calus right on release). 
  Maybe I have some inherent bias against the French?  Still, I heard this game is
  one of their weaker titles so maybe I didn''t miss anything. 1960: the Making of
  the President - this was always in action at the convention and it would have been
  nice for Jim and I to give it a go to work out the mechanics.  I re-read the rules
  here on the airplane and I think I''m ready to teach and play this with Jacob (or
  Julie?) so this is a minor regret. Galaxy Trucker - For some reason I lacked any
  desire to play this game, but my regret comes from amazement with how much it was
  played at BGG.CON.  Is this any good?  Leave a comment and let me know if I should
  play it.   Conclusions I think the crop of games coming this year is the best in
  the last 2 years.  I''m thrilled that I chose BGG.CON over Essen as I wouldn''t
  have had the chance to actually play most of these titles if I''d gone to Germany. 
  I think Brass, Agricola, Cuba, and Race for the Galaxy compare very well with and
  even surpass prior years (Caylus, Pillars of the Earth, Havoc :-) and that our gaming
  hobby is doing just fine.  I''m thrilled that we are moving past the idea of "German
  Gaming" and "Euro Gaming" to a real blend of styles that take the best of all worlds
  in terms of mechanics, theme, and replayability.  If you play these games and didn''t
  attend BGG.CON, find a way to go next year!  I may even need a roommate...'
