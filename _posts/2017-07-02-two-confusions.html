<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/06/two-confusions.html">Seth Godin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those things you're bad at? You're not nearly as bad at them as you fear.</p>
<p>And those things you're great at? Probably not nearly as good as you hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>We all need to love ourselves more, loathe ourselves less, and focus more on magnifying our strengths rather than obsessing over our weaknesses.</p>
