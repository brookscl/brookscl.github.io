excerpt: 'Saturday marked the end of Matthew''s football season, the end of Jacob''s
  regular season (they have a playoff game next weekend), and a chance for Jacob and
  I to try out a new Essen release: Through the Ages.  This is another civ building
  game, but unlike many in the genre there''s no map.  This is essentially a card
  game that most reminded me of the 2005 release Parthenon: Rise of the Aegean.  The
  map in Parthenon was largely superfluous, and I applaud the Czech Board Games folks
  for streamlining the game in this manner. Through the Ages comes with three different
  play levels: simple, advanced, and full.  The simple game is meant to introduce
  players to the basic mechanics with no direct conflict allowed between players. 
  This is what Jacob and I tried on Saturday night, starting at 8pm and finishing
  before 10pm.  Each player starts with a basic civ - despotism government, a couple
  of farms, a couple of mines, a lab, and a warrior.  These are represented by cards
  plus workers (little yellow glass stones).  In general, a card represents the capability
  of building something (i.e., the technology).  The yellow stones represent population,
  so when a yellow stone is on a card that signifies that you''ve built that building
  and are manning it to bring some good to your civ. Your government determines the
  actions you can do on a turn, with the starting civ of Despotism giving each player
  4 civil actions and 2 military actions.  Civil actions are used to draft cards,
  increase population, play cards, and build buildings.  Military actions are used
  to train new warriors in the simple game. What I think makes the game special are
  the civil event cards.  These are brought out on a holding board and are purchased
  using civil actions.  These cycle through the board and get cheaper as they slide
  left (think of the drafting mechanism in Atlantic Star), with the three left-most
  cards leaving the game each turn in the 2-player game.  The cards allow players
  to customize their civ and choose their own path, including leadership, government,
  technologies, and production. Our simple game felt like it was over almost before
  it started, and the designers should take this as a compliment.  It really is an
  introductory scenario and it served us well in teaching the basic mechanics of the
  game, and I was thrilled that we were able to complete this in less than two hours
  including setup and instruction.  We thought I had won, but in hindsight Jacob probably
  won as we miscounted some of the bonus points.  Jacob and I embarked on an advanced
  game this morning at 9am.  The advanced game includes all of the rules of the full
  game minus the ability to declare war (though there is military conflict) but is
  played without the 3rd age cards. There''s a system of checks and balances at work
  in the game, not unlike Antiquity.  You have to do some planning and forecasting
  to make sure that you keep enough resources (food and mined product) around to do
  the things you want to do, but not keep around too much.  The advanced game introduces
  the notions of happiness and corruption which forces players to balance their development,
  keep their population happy (mostly by supplying religion), and not stockpile too
  much of their goods.  It also forces a level of efficiency in production, as the
  finite number of resource counters can represent different numbers of raw goods
  depending on where they live.  A token on a basic iron mine may be worth 1 resource,
  while the same token on a bronze mine is worth 2 resources.  Jacob pulled ahead
  early in military strength which turned out to be a big advantage as the advanced
  game introduces military events, many of which benefit the player with the most
  strength (or hurt the player that is weakest).  I clawed my way back, mostly through
  superior resource production, and was able to slingshot past him in the last turn
  in military strength.  This gave me a 10 point bonus at the end which turned out
  to be the difference in the game.  The bonus came from a set of 4 random 3rd age
  event cards that we flipped over at the start of the game which specify bonuses
  players can earn based on the state of their civs. We completed the advanced game
  in just under three hours and had a blast.  There''s more interaction in the advanced
  game but this is still largely a do-your-own-thing sort of game.  The downtime was
  minimal with 2 players, but I can see it getting excessive with more players.  I
  do need to give the designers credit in specifying how to minimize downtime in the
  rules - they encourage the next player to start his turn once the current player
  completes his actions and starts end-of-turn production.  We followed this guidance
  and found the time between turns to be no more than 5-10 minutes, sometimes even
  less.  After 2 plays Jacob and I are rating this one a 9 and look forward to playing
  the full game.'
