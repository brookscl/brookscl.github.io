excerpt: We finally got out into the estuary waters around Siletz Bay.  Dave is out
  here for a group weekend with my regular group that I scheduled a while back as
  a mid-stream alternative to the regular Sunriver trips we make.  The rest of the
  crowd arrives tonight.         We put in right at the Siletz Bay National Wildlife
  Refuge.  Jacob consulted the tide charts last night and our timing was great.  You
  really need to hit it around high tide to get around.         The trees and wildlife
  are very cool here.  This area was very damaged by sawmill runoff but is on a steady
  recovery.         We paddled under the 101 bridge to show Dave Siletz Bay proper. 
  Didn't see any harbor seals this time though.
