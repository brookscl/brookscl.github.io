excerpt: 'Ken Rude and I traveled to Kevin''s house for our first  gaming session
  with the Portland  Gamers.  Kevin is the gracious host for this group, and Jeff
  had gamed  a few times before with Kevin.  Doug, Mimi, Ken, and I were all newcomers  to
  the group.  Thanks to Kevin  for hosting - I think everyone had a great time. Attendees:
  Chris Brooks, Ken Rude, Jeff Fisher, Doug Walker, Mimi Walker,  Kevin Graham Games
  Played: Zendo, Dragon Delta, Fist of  Dragonstones, Condottiere, Bohnanza Zendo
  Played By: Chris B. Ken R. Jeff F. Doug W. Mimi W. Kevin G. Game Length: 45 min.
  We played Zendo as an opener while we awaited possible late arrivals. Nobody  turned
  up, but we had fun teaching Doug, Mimi, and Ken this Zen game with  Icehouse pieces.
  Winner(s):  Finish: Chris B. Ken R. Jeff F. Doug W. Mimi W. Kevin G. Dragon Delta
  Played By: Chris B. Ken R. Jeff F. Doug W. Mimi W. Kevin G. Game Length: 60 min.
  Chris brought this game of Chinese youths competing to lay planks to cross the  delta.
  Everyone enjoyed this game, though we realized part way that I''ve been  playing
  wrong: all players turn over their cards for the current round before  the first
  player takes their action. This could certainly affect choices made  when placing
  planks, removing planks, etc. Winner(s): Chris B. Fist of Dragonstones Played By:
  Chris B. Ken R. Jeff F. Doug W. Mimi W. Kevin G. Game Length: 60 min. This is a
  game worth playing once, but possibly not more frequently. It has a  nice theme,
  and interesting bits, but the blind bidding frustrates people. Poor  Doug was frequently
  just barely on the losing end, which is most annoying. We  only played to 2 victory
  points to cut the game short. Winner(s): Ken R. Condottiere Played By: Chris B.
  Ken R. Jeff F. Doug W. Mimi W. Kevin G. Game Length: 60 min. Kevin introduced this
  game - Doug and Mimi had played before, but the rest of us  haven''t. This is a
  much more pleasant bidding and bluffing game than Fist of  Dragonstones, and one
  I might consider adding to my collection. There does  appear to be a strong luck
  element in the draw. Winner(s): Ken R. Bohnanza Played By: Chris B. Ken R. Jeff
  F. Doug W. Mimi W. Kevin G. Game Length: 60 min. I requested this for a closer since
  I''ve heard so much about it but have never  played. Definitely a light game, but
  I think my kids might enjoy it. One thing I  like is that there is very little downtime
  with all of the trading going on. Winner(s): Mimi W.  Session Report generated by
