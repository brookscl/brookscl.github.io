<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Of course, more <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/25876326">Advanced Squad Leader</a> with Doug. We are in the middle of a German / Dutch early war campaign.</li>
<li>I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/25879060">Combat Commander: Europe</a> with my young friend Peter who just shipped off for US Army basic training.</li>
<li>I taught newbie friend Spence how to play <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/25949477">Twilight Struggle</a> and it has reignited the flame for me to play more on my iPad. I also tricked out my 1ed box with some foam core inserts I built.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://silverwraith.com/blog/2017/10/the-senior-engineers-guide-to-helping-others-make-decisions/">The Senior Engineer’s Guide to Helping Others Make Decisions</a> – Outstanding article here with memorable examples about how we lead (and don’t lead) folks that we are mentoring.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@sicross/the-product-managers-essential-reading-list-for-2018-72f43b441ced">The Product Manager’s Essential Reading List for 2018</a> – Can’t argue with most of these, though <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> is a bit of a stretch.</li>
<li><a href="http://firstround.com/review/these-13-exercises-will-prepare-you-for-works-toughest-situations/">These 13 Exercises Will Prepare You for Work’s Toughest Situations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/doree/meet-the-people-who-listen-to-podcasts-at-super-fast-speeds">Meet the People Who Listen to Podcasts at Super-Fast Speeds</a> – <strong>Raises hand</strong>. I use the <a href="https://overcast.fm/podcasts">Overcast</a> app and listen at 2x speed to most of my podcasts. The app allows for podcast-specific settings which is nice for ones that often involve non-native English speakers like <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510324/rough-translation">Rough Translation</a>.</li>
