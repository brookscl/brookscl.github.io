excerpt: 'While watching the Cardinals look ever more futile this evening, I managed
  to try out a few solitaire Piecepack games. First up was Tula (ppwiki), which feels
  like a solitaire card game.  This is an enjoyable puzzle game where you try to deconstruct
  a tower (temple) of tiles by matching either the suit or the rank with the last
  piece removed.  There''s some pathmaking and memory involved and it was a fine diversion.
  Next up was One Man: Thrag! (ppwiki).  A fun diversion, but too luck driven for
  my taste.  There isn''t much strategy involved - mostly a figure-the-odds and decide
  if you want to roll the dice to kill a monster.'
