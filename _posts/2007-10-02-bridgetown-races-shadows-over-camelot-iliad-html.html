excerpt: ' I played games for the first time in 3 months last week, a trend I will
  continue tonight as I make it to my first RipCityGamer session since July.   Carey
  came over in the afternoon to playtest one of his new designs, a supposed race game
  called Bridgetown Races.  I say supposed because I wouldn''t classify it as a racing
  game - it is more of a logistics or traveling salesman game.    This was a fun experience
  and reminded me of what I like the most about publishing games - playtesting and
  collaborating on new designs.  I can''t design myself out of a box, but I sure can
  be critical when I need to and Carey was great about taking feedback and innovating
  on the spot.  We played once with his current design then made some drastic changes
  and tried it again with good results.  He''s still polishing and enhancing as there''s
  work to be done - the game needs a bit more arc to it the board spacing needs some
  work.       Ken and Brandon stopped by on Sunday (no baseball due to rain, something
  we were all hoping for this time around) for some overdue gaming.  We haven''t picked
  up our D&D campaign since early this year and we are all anxious to get some free
  weekend time to dive in again.  We had limited time on Sunday so we elected to play
  Shadows Over Camelot.        We had a good time but the finish was anti-climatic
  as we non-traitors fell asleep at the wheel and allowed 11 siege engines to accumulate
  at Camelot, making it easy for traitor Ken to finish us off.  Just like that, game
  over 60 minutes into the game.  Bah.  At least it left us time to play another.        Iliad
  has been sitting on my un-played list    since I acquired it in a math trade earlier
  this year so gave that a try.  This is a fun (but a bit long) game reminiscent of
  Havoc and Condotierre.  We had a great finish to the game, with a "Gorgon" battle
  coming up last and a great sudden death battle for the finish.    There was a clear
  king-maker opportunity at the end for me, especially if I took the chance to do
  some real analysis.  I opted instead to just give Jacob the battle victory and see
  where the final results would fall out (Brandon was in the lead so letting him win
  would be a mistake) and Jacob did indeed turn out to be the victor.  It was a fun
  finish to a fun game, though shortening it a bit might be nice.  We played for about
  90 minutes. Tonight I''m off to Mike Dean''s for our game group''s regular Tuesday
  gaming session so I''ll report on that soon.'
