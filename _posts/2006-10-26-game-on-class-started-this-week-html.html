excerpt: 'Julie and I started the Game On! class this week at Matthew''s school (read
  more here and here).  We ended up doing two classes to accomodate the 40 kids that
  signed up.  The Wednesday class is mostly 3rd/4th graders and the Thursday class
  is 4th/5th graders.  Julie will usually teach Wed and I''ll take Thu, though with
  my travel schedule we will often flip things around. Julie and I tag-teamed our
  first class on Wednesday.  We started with an overview of the class, discussed rules
  and guidelines, mentioned a few of the games we expect to play, then dove right
  into explanation of our first game: Walk the Dogs.  This turned out to be a great
  choice.  Julie had the great idea of having the kids rate the games on a 4-point
  scale (we are using Chuck''s system) and most rated it a 4 with just a few giving
  it a 3.  Same results on Thursday.  All but one of the groups in the 2 days were
  able to finish their games.  Turns out the setup time for Walk the Dogs is longer
  than I remembered, so on the second day I took the time to set up the doggies ahead
  of time.  That is part of the fun of the game, but I figured it was a reasonable
  tradeoff to give the kids a better chance of finishing. Next week we will likely
  play Pickomino, followed by Take it Easy.  After that we''ll revisit all three games
  and give the kids the chance to pick one of them for play during an open gaming
  session.'
