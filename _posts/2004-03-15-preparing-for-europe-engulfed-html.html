excerpt: A strange title for a post, but I've spent the last week reading (and re-reading)
  the rules for Europe Engulfed in anticipating of a trial short scenario play with
  Jacob.  One thing I love about “German” or “European” style board games is that
  they are very approachable - I can usually learn and teach the game to the family
  within an hour. Wargames like EE take a real investment to learn - ideally you can
  be taught by someone who already knows the game, but I don't have that luxury. 
  So right now I'm in the process of reading the rules, checking the errata online,
  looking at the map (conveniently setup on my dining room table - Julie just loves
  that), and re-reading the rules. Of course, reading Chris Farrell's recent post
  makes me believe it will all be worthwhile.
