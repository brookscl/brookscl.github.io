excerpt: 'I took what I think was a deserved break from volunteer activities this
  weekend, allowing Julie to accompany the boys on a scout camp-out. I proceeded to
  fill my gaming dance card with Doug from 11am-2pm and Ken from 2pm-whenever. Doug
  and I scheduled a game of We the People in preparation for a planned play next week
  with Jim Ginn at BGG.CON (follow on Twitter). We the People is the original card-driven
  game and the ancestor of great games like Hannibal: Rome vs Carthaage, Twilight
  Struggle, Paths of Glory, and derivatives like Memoir ''44 and Combat Commander.
  Having read the rules I felt prepared to dive in and learn some strategies as the
  game progressed - I also knew that Doug would kindly guide me around foolish newbie
  mistakes (Doug''s write-up of this session is already posted).  The game is very
  comfortable and friendly - it feels like a slimmer version of Hannibal and Twilight
  Struggle combined. It lacks the refinement of those games, particularly in the ways
  that bum hands can really set a player back, but is short enough to make it easy
  to overlook any weakness.  I hung in there but struggled with forecasting the impact
  of political counter isolation and got burned a few times. These point-to-point
  games often have many subtleties in the geometry of point connections that take
  some getting used to. 6 or 7 turns into the game I held a card that was almost certain
  to end the game and struggled to push things to a draw but just couldn''t manage.
  Still it was fun and we finished in just under 3 hours and just in time for Ken''s
  arrival (and Doug''s departure). Ken has never had the pleasure of playing Agricola
  so that was first up. We had a very typical first game where Ken slowly figured
  out the engine but struggled to keep up with me and grow his family early enough
  to have an impact. We played with the Intermediate cards right from the get-go.  Our
  second game was a turnaround and Ken got some great production going early and I
  floundered with some poor occupation choices early in the game. He won this game
  46-36 - a great score for a second game!  Ken and I wrapped up the evening with
  three games of Dominion. I knew this would resonate with Ken - we started our gaming
  together with Magic: the Gathering about 5 or 6 years ago. Like Agricola, Ken closed
  the victory gap quickly and we tied our third game with 36 points each. What made
  this evening especially enjoyable was the mix of cards we played with and I''ve
  now played with the entire mix of cards. I should get to play this some more tomorrow
  with KC & Rita.'
