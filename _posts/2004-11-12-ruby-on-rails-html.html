excerpt: 'OK, let''s geek out in the technical way for a bit.  Patrick mentioned that
  I pointed him to Ruby, and more specifically to Ruby on Rails.  I''m quickly falling
  in love (in a geek sort of way) with the language and framework.  I''ve been a long-time
  fan of Python (check out this discussion on Python vs. Ruby), but there''s something
  about Ruby that just clicks for me. Side note: Patrick, you asked about doing web
  services / SOAP on Ruby.  Check out soap4r.  Looks like a decent framework and some
  of the basic tests seem to work. Other side note: When you search for ruby “web
  services” you get tons of hits for Sam Ruby.  Best to exclude Sam when looking for
  more info on this topic. Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework that strives
  for simplicity, elegance, and “Principle of Least Surprise”.  The most interesting
  component of Rails is ActiveRecord, the simplest object-relational mapping framework
  I''ve ever seen. I''m doing a personal project to aggregate boardgame pricing data
  from various online vendors.  To do this, I need to have a master database of games
  that I can easily keep up to date.  Enter BoardGameGeek - I''d love it if they would
  offer a web services interface, but for now I''ll have to resort to screen-scraping
  their HTML output. Now, for some code.  First, some SQL DDL to define the games
  table: CREATE TABLE games (  id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement,  title
  varchar(50) NOT NULL default '''',  boardgamegeekID int(10) NOT NULL default ''0'', 
  publisher varchar(255) NOT NULL default '''',  updateddate datetime NOT NULL default
  ''0000-00-00 00:00:00'',  PRIMARY KEY  (id),  KEY title (title)) TYPE=MyISAM; I
  then use a Rails script to generate the model, which is a class representation of
  this table structure.  Rails uses Ruby reflection extensively, so the code for the
  model is almost laughingly simple: require ''activerecord''class Game < ActiveRecord::Baseend
  Yes, that''s it.  ActiveRecord will automatically use metadata from the database
  to determine what attributes to provide, how to generate SQL for CRUD operations,
  etc. I''ll talk about the controller / view side of things later, but for now I''ll
  stick to showing some the code used to scrape BGG and populate the database: require
  ''open-uri''require ''config/environments/production''require ''app/models/game''yearmin
  = ''1960''yearmax = ''2010''puts "Searching BoardGameGeek to harvest games from
  " + yearmin + " to " + yearmaxsearchURI = "http://www.boardgamegeek.com/search.php3?yearmin="
  + yearmin + "&yearmax=" + yearmaxopen(searchURI) do |f|  results = f.read.scan(/A.href="/game/(.*?)">(.*?)</) 
  for row in results    g = Game.new    g.title = row[1]    g.boardgamegeekID = row[0]   
  g.publisher = '' ''    g.updateddate = DateTime.now    puts ''Found game: '' + g.title
  + '' with ID '' + g.boardgamegeekID.to_s    g.save  endend That''s it.  This is
  just a loader and I''ll need some more elegance to maintain this over time (e.g.,
  checking for duplicate entries, leveraging BGG''s numbering system to avoid revisiting
  games already loaded, etc.).  Pretty cool stuff, huh?'
