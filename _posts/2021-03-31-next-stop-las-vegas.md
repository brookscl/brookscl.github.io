Julie and I are on the road to Las Vegas in our best mechanical friend "Rooster". Rooster is the moniker for the Subaru Xtrek that has accompanied us on our adventures throughout the USA. His name is Rooster because he has true grit. Maybe you get the reference.

We will get some quality time with family in Las Vegas, I'll play a round of golf at a nice local course ([Bear's Best](https://www.clubcorp.com/Clubs/Bear-s-Best-Las-Vegas)), and we will pick up our [Escape Mavericks campervan](https://www.escapecampervans.com/campervans/mavericks/). Why take a chance on buying a campervan when you can rent one first? We will roam throughout southern Utah for three weeks, so expect to see a lot more photo blog posts from me in the coming weeks.
