excerpt: 'Jacob and Matthew are playing baseball again this year.  Though they are
  almost two years apart, it seems that Matthew is always only one year behind him
  in the league.  This is mostly due to mom & dad wanting to push him along a little
  faster. In Sherwood, if you play youth baseball you are part of Junior Baseball
  of Oregon.  JBO is quite a bit different than Little League, and so far I have been
  impressed.  At each age level, there are three divisions: National, American, and
  Federal.  The Federal team (there is only one) is the all-star team and plays together
  all season, often traveling to tournaments outside the city.  The next level is
  American, which is very competitive and travels frequently, but is not quite at
  the Federal level.  National is for beginning or recreational level players. When
  I grew up, everyone at the same age level played in the same league, and at the
  end of the season an all-star team was chosen from the teams to compete in the post-season. 
  I like the JBO model since it allows players to spend the entire season playing
  with players at about the same skill level.         Matthew posing for his individual
  picture. Matthew is in a developmental league (pre-JBO) called Midget International. 
  This is meant to be a transitional league for players that want to play real ball
  (stealing, player pitching, etc.) but aren''t old enough for Midget.  This is where
  Jacob played last year.         Matthew''s baseball team. Jacob tried out earlier
  to see where he would play, and was drafted by a Midget American team.  In fact,
  his two coaches also coached him in football.  This league is a stretch for Jacob
  - he is not used to this level of competitiveness, and it is tough not being one
  of the 2 or 3 best players on the team.         Jacob (right) listening to coach
  after practice. So far, his skills are improving and he is hanging in there. It
  looks like he will be the backup catcher and spend most his time playing outfield. 
  Jacob isn''t the most agile, strongest, or most talented player, but his attitude
  is amazing and the coaches love him for his listening skills and work ethic.         Action
  shot of Jacob rounding 3rd base during practice. One challenge for Julie and I is
  to keep our feedback as close to 100% positive as possible.  His coaches challenge
  him enough, and his self confidence wanes at times, so our roles need to be almost
  completely reinforcing.         Jacob slides into 3rd during practice.'
