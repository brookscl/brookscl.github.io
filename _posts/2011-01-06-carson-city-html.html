<p>Doug, Mike, and I played <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39938/carson-city">Carson City</a> last night - a first play for Doug and Mike, and my only play since a five-player introduction at BGG.CON back in November.  In hindsight I wish I had prepared a bit more (wasn't sure if we'd have 2 or 3 players) as a few rules were missed that may have soured the experience.</p>

<p>Carson City is a worker placement with a linear action progression, clearly influenced by <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus">Caylus</a> but with a very different and competitive aspect.  Players compete via parcel and building placement on the map as well as by dueling for action selection.  We played the more <em>strategic</em> variant that gives each player a randomly selected set of gun firepower tiles (and compensates weak / strong hands with more or less money at the start) but had a grand total of two duels in the game.</p>

<p>A few rules that we missed for a while or that I glossed over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the buildings bring a benefit to the owner's other buildings that can be <em>anywhere</em> on the board, not just adjacent to the building.</li>
<li>For the buildings with a mandatory house placement, the house just needs to be placed reachable by a road connected to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, this is a sufficiently involved game that I think any first play is going to be a bit scattered even if played correctly. I want to get 4 more plays in within the next few months to see if this game is sticky.</p>
