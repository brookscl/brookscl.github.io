excerpt: The weekend gaming ended with a day of mostly longer fare.  Doug left around
  noon, the rest of us departed around 4pm.         George and Mike squared off in
  a game of War of the Ring.  I need to play this game!  Jacob and I have played a
  few turns but couldn't finish and had to clean up.  I believe the Fellowship (George)
  had the upper hand in this game when they decided to call it quits.         Doug,
  Dave, Jacob, and I played the new Martin Wallace game Struggle of Empires.  This
  game has potential, but man I had a rough start.  You see, to move troops across
  open waters you need to make a single d6 roll.  If a 1 comes up, you roll again. 
  1-2, you lose the unit to sharks, 3-4, the unit has to return, 5-6, no effect. 
  I'm sure my memory is off here, but out of the first 10 times I tried to move units
  this way, I think I rolled a one 8 or 9 times.  Shame on me for trying to be so
  bold as conquering India I suppose.  There's some real game under the hood though
  and I look forward to playing again.         After Doug left we watched some NFL
  playoff football.  Pick Picknic seemed like appropriately light fare.  This was
  my second play of this game (the first was the original Hick Hack in Gackelwack)
  and I think it is quite fun.  It is basically a silly guessing game - think of a
  much lighter version of Hoity Toity.         Mike, Dave, and George play El Caballero.         Jacob
  and I play Dracula, a solid 2 player game with a memory element that doesn't bother
  me too much.  This needs to come out more often as it plays quickly and has some
  decent strategy around hand management.         One of my personal highlights of
  the week was watching Dave play Bop-It Extreme.  Apparently the best way to score
  high is to get your whole body in synch with the music.
