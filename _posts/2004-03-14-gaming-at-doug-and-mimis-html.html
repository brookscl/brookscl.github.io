excerpt: 'Yesterday Jacob and I made the long trek up to Vancouver''s east side to
  attend a game day hosted by Doug & Mimi.  It had been too long since our last visit,
  so it was good to reconnect.  Attendance was great - there were nine of us there
  for most of the afternoon. Desert Oasis The crowd was interested in some of the
  newer titles I brought, so we started one group of four with Desert Oasis.  This
  game is very easy to teach and everyone caught on quickly.  Matt immediately started
  building up a dominance on the camel track, and somehow the bidding worked out so
  much in his favor that he was able to grab a healthy chunk of the camel scoring
  tiles as well.  This was my first taste of bad luck with this game - I had poor
  cards and rarely was able to snag the #1 player spot.  Still, I did fairly well
  with the stone tiles and finished a respectable second place.  Respectable, that
  is, relative to third and fourth because Matt managed to score around 194 points,
  80 points ahead of me.        Doug, David, Matt, and I play Desert Oasis while Tyler
  observes. Attika Meanwhile Jacob taught Mimi, Dave, and Kevin how to play Attika. 
  Kevin expressed some concern that it was a bit dry, but is willing to try it a few
  more times.  I think the game gets better once all of the players know the rules
  and the game goes at a decent clip.  Mimi won this one.        Jacob taught Mimi,
  Dave, and Kevin how to play Attika. Alhambra Alhambra was the next to come out. 
  Again, this is an easy game to teach so we were able to get started very quickly. 
  Tyler had a great start, with several exact value purchases happening early in the
  game.  David turned out to be the strong player here, winning by 13 points.  I finished
  last - my only signicant scoring coming from my towers.        Tyler, David, Jacob,
  Kevin, and I played Alhambra. Nautilus I still don''t know much about this exploration
  game other than it takes a while to play.  Doug, Mimi, Matt, and Dave were at it
  for about 2.5 hours.  I believe Doug won.        Doug, Mimi, Matt, and Dave play
  Nautilus. Puerto Rico While we were waiting for Nautilus to finish, we searched
  the voluminous shelves for a good five player game.  Someone suggested Puerto Rico,
  and everyone agreed.  It was an interesting game with very different strategies
  competing.  Kevin focused on corn and shipping, racking up tons of victory points
  throughout the game.  David had a mix of shipping (mostly sugar) and buildings. 
  I focused on higher value production and buildings.  For most of the game I had
  a monopoly on tobacco, and several times I was able to trade by myself.  This allowed
  me to build two of the large buildings.  Unfortunately I made a bad choice in one
  of the buildings - I chose the one that pays extra VPs for the number of plantation
  squares populated, when I should have chosen the one that gives a bonus for violet
  buildings.  I ended up filling out all of my building squares in the same round
  we ran out of colonists.  The game ended in a very close finish - Kevin had 47,
  I had 45, and David had 43.        Tyler, David, Jacob, Kevin, and I play Puerto
  Rico. Relationship Tightrope Mimi was kind enough to prepare a tasty Italian dinner
  for us, so while she finished the meal Doug, Tyler, Jacob, Kevin, and I played the
  newest Uberplay release Relationship Tightrope.  The theme (trying to balance a
  male/female relationship) has never bothered me, but it looks like quite a few folks
  are annoyed by the topic.  There are certainly some stereotypes on the cards that
  might offend some.  Jacob and I really enjoy the game play, but Doug, Tyler, and
  Kevin were fairly neutral on the game.  Doug managed a victory with the final scores:
  Doug (3), Tyler (6), Chris (15), Jacob (34), Kevin (36).        Jacob, Tyler, Doug,
  Kevin and I play Relationship Tightrope.  They weren''t having as much fun as they
  are letting on. Finstere Flure We finished the evening with the most recent Friedemann
  Friese game about monsters chasing hapless characters trying to escape from a dungeon. 
  The game never interested me enough to try it before, but I thought Jacob would
  enjoy it so I agreed to bring this one out.        Doug explains the rules to Jacob,
  Tyler, Kevin, and me. This game is quite a bit more fun than I expected.  Some of
  the enjoyment comes from trying to predict where the monster will go and moving
  accordingly.  Most of the fun comes from moving your characters so that the monster
  will chase and kill your opponents'' characters!  This is a fun race game that I
  would definitely be willing to play again.  I managed to win, escaping with two
  of my characters.        Cool monster.'
