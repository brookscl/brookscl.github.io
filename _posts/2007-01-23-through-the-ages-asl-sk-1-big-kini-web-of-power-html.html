excerpt: 'Time to catch up on some recent gaming! Through the Ages Two weekends ago
  Jacob and I tried to take on the full game of Through the Ages.  Jacob has been
  itching to play this again and I was happy to accommodate - this was clearly one
  of the top games I played in 2006. The last time we played we tried the advanced
  game and we were excited to experience the full experience - mostly because we wanted
  to get Bill Gates as a leader.  I did a much better job this time around managing
  my military.  I wanted to make sure I didn''t fall too far behind him and get sent
  into a downward spiral as we started to reveal events.  This strategy worked out
  well, especially coupled with Michelangelo - I had a stable military with some accelerated
  culture production that allowed me to race away with the lead. Four hours into the
  game, we were easily 2 hours from being done.  I was so far ahead that we both agreed
  to stop the game.  The game felt longer this time around, and I''m not sure why. 
  Downtime wasn''t bad at all, so maybe it was just unfamiliarity with the rules at
  the start.  Still, I''m not sure I''m prepared to invest 5-6 hours for the full
  game. ASK Start Kit #1 Time to revisit my nemesis ASL, via the second scenario of
  the Starter Kit #1 that introduces machine guns.  If you recall, we made good progress
  last time we played this but I still expressed some frustration with the rules and
  jargon. I truly thought we''d be well poised to move on to the next set of rules,
  but in reality we were right back where we started.  As I read the rules, I keep
  wanting to create my own abstractions to simplify things - I just don''t care about
  the level of realism that the core system offers.  The terseness of the rules is
  such a hindrance, and the index is nearly worthless.  Case in point: we were trying
  to figure out ROF (rate-of-fire) for LMGs (light machine guns) etc.  I understand
  the concept, but I could not for the life of me figure out how you determine if
  the gun gets another fire.  Look up ROF in the index and you get pointed to MG section,
  but there''s no clue there as to how ROF is triggered.  Turns out this is explained
  in brief early on in the rules, and it took 5-10 minutes of reading and re-reading
  to figure this out.  Imagine how frustrating it is for Jacob to sit there wait while
  I dig through the rules trying to figure out this (very important) rule.  This is
  where being terse is a huge hindrance for the rules - MMP should double the size
  of the rulebook and include redundant information as appropriate via callouts and
  other explanatory text.  I''m sure the SK is big improvement over starting with
  the ASL rulebook, but I think there''s room for improvement.  After receiving Combat
  Commander: Europe last week I''m forecasting that ASL will never get played again
  in my household in favor for this lighter, more dynamic squad level game.  More
  on that later. Big Kini I''ve played Big Kini 3 times in the past few weeks and
  I continue to be impressed with this mostly undiscovered game.  Doug did a nice
  writeup of my last session playing this and brought up a good point about the human
  factors, but I wouldn''t get too concerned about his issues.  I think after a play
  or two the eye candy on the board gets to be pretty decipherable. Web of Power I
  finally got a chance to play Web of Power while over at Mike''s a couple of weeks
  ago.  Wow, what a fun but tough game to figure out (strategy-wise).  I''ve been
  reading about Web of Power (and the related game China) for some time but never
  pulled the trigger on a purchase, primarily because I''d like to try before I buy. 
  George had played before but needed some time to refresh on the rules, but once
  we started the game was over within 45 minutes.  Matt did an impressive job taking
  advantage of connections between provinces (I didn''t even notice the connections
  over sea lanes!) and easily beat us.  A fun time and I''d like to try China now
  to see if that would be a good purchase option.'
