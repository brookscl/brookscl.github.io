excerpt: "                            My streak of hooking up with extremely cool
  groups of gamers across the             USA continued this week. I’m in Dallas,
  TX             for Microsoft TechEd,             and managed to hook up with The
  Card Benders, a group of about 6-10 gamers that meets             twice a week.
  Member John Haley was kind enough             to respond to my query for groups
  on spielfrieks,             so I joined them at a local Borders.                                Turns
  out my timing was perfect – they had 7 show up,             but 5 of them desperately
  wanted to play Mare             Nostrum, but were reluctant to leave the other two
  to fend for themselves. I             made three, so everyone was happy. I spent
  \            the evening gaming with Tim Isakson and Charles Schwope. On             to
  the games…                   Trias                                We kicked things
  off with this game about dinosaur migration and plate tectonics. This             one
  reminded me of Clans, but I enjoyed this more. I think the theme works, and I             enjoy
  games with evolving playing surfaces. I             felt that I could wrap my brain
  around the shifting out of tiles, and I think I played             fairly well.
  I had a shot at winning, but Charles             pulled ahead at the end with some
  strong moves. Might             have to pick this one up.                   Paris
  Paris                                I’ve been wanting to play this one since reading
  \            the Gathering reports, so after spotting this in the bag-o-games, I
  requested we try             this one next. In Paris Paris you             are trying
  to open businesses in strategic locations in Paris to take advantage of             the
  tourist bus lines. Some call this game             light, but there’s clearly a
  strategic element to this game and I want to play some             more. Most likely
  I’ll give it a try on BSW a             few times before purchasing. I got crushed
  \            in this game – don’t recall the score, but I was in third and down
  by at least 8 points.                   Schnäppchen Jagd (Good             Deal
  Hunt)                                This is a very unique trick-taking game. Rather
  \            than just trying to take the most tricks, or trying to avoid certain
  poison cards,             players are trying to accumulate specific face values
  (the target changes throughout             the game) or melds of other face values.
  For             example, I might start the game trying to accumulate 3’s, but will
  of course accumulate             (by taking tricks) other numbers as well. The             goal
  is to consolidate the collection of other cards to as few distinct face values             as
  possible. Scoring at the end is calculated             by subtracting the number
  of “other” cards from the number of targets accumulated. After             each
  hand, players can exchange cards in their bad pile by sending a single face value
  \            back to the deck. Players get to transfer any             cards in
  excess of three to their good pile. The             result is that early in the
  game players are trying to take tricks and accumulate             groups, while
  later in the game players are avoiding tricks, dumping cards from their             hand,
  and trying to take only tricks that help them get target cards or consolidate             their
  holdings. I was happy to score zero;             I believe Tim won.                   Zirkus
  Flohcati (Flea             Circus)                                This is a fun,
  light card game where players are trying to accumulate sets of             cards,
  and players get the choice of choosing one of a set of face-up cards or flipping
  \            until a better one shows up. If a card is turned             up that
  is the same suit as an existing card, then that card is discarded and the             player
  loses a turn. Scoring is straightforward,             but just read the BGG entry
  to see more. I             just learned that the Star Wars: Attack of the Clones
  card game is the same game –             my kids will like this one. Tim won this
  game             easily.                                                                The
  group playing Mare Nostrum finished at about this time, so we sat around             chatting
  about gaming, geekness, and Oregon. We             somehow got on the subject of
  train games, and Randy Shipp shared a hilarious story             about a letter
  he wrote to the designer of Tracks             to Telluride (John Bohrer)             about
  what he (and the group) thought were some design flaws. Apparently             John
  didn’t think too highly of Randy’s comments and questioned the sophistication             of
  his American gaming audience. You’ll have             to ask him yourself for the
  whole story and the punchline.                "
