excerpt: 'About a year ago Julie and I committed to spending a full 6 weeks at Keuka
  Lake in 2008, and we are making it happen. This meant no baseball for the boys this
  year and some challenges managing our pets at home, but we are here and excited
  to settle down for a while and enjoy the lake. I am back at work (more on that later)
  and will be working full time for the duration. Here''s a snapshot of my "lake office":  We
  will have some guests here throughout the summer, and the boys and I will spend
  a week of Boy Scout summer camp at Camp Gorton on the next lake over in mid July.  Yes,
  I do expect to finish my Europe trip postings this week.  Travel'
