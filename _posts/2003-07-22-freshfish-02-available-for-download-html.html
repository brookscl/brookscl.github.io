excerpt: "              I finally have a working standalone version of Fresh         Fish
  available for download.  In the download you will find the executable         (just
  run FreshFishGUI.exe out of the /bin directory) and the source code.  You         will
  need to have the .NET         Framework Version 1.1 Redistributable Package to run
  this game (sorry non-Windows         users...).  I'm calling this version 0.2 -
  it still needs a lot of work, but         is playable.  I would love to hear your
  comments, so either post them here or         join me at the boardgamecoders Yahoo
  \        group and ask questions there.      "
