excerpt: " Jacob and Matthew have a long 4-day weekend (Julie's dad arrives tomorrow
  morning), so without an early bedtime we decided to play Ticket to Ride after dinner. 
  I had only played once before and was eager to teach the boys - we love train games
  and I thought this would hit a sweet spot in terms of complexity and fun.         Jacob
  and Matthew about mid-way through the game.  I played red, Jacob black, and Matthew
  blue. Ticket to Ride is a fantastic game in so many ways.  It plays very fast with
  almost no downtime, there are strategic elements (many routes or long routes), tactical
  plays (blocking, throwing down a shorter route out of fear of being blocked), and
  tension because it can be difficult to estimate the final point totals.  Throw in
  trains and a decent geography lesson and you have a winner of a family strategy
  game.  I was able to teach the boys how to play in less than five minutes, so this
  game should be very attractive to families with younger (7+) kids.         Grin
  away, Mr. Lucky. I wish I could say that I was playing to let the boys win, but
  I was sincerely trying to play my best.  Matthew smoked us as usual, finishing 30
  points ahead of Jacob and me.  Some of it was luck of the draw - he drew a destination
  ticket in his second-to-last turn and picked up a 22 pointer that he had already
  built!"
