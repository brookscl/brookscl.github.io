excerpt: I guess this shouldn't be a surprise given the strong positive correlation
  between those who game and those in IT, but I was certainly a bit surprised when
  I saw Gerry Heidenreich's posting about German Boardgames.  The posting included
  a link to my blog as well as Susan Rozmiarek's. I read Gerry's weblog primarily
  for the technical content.  We also seem to have a few things in common; for example,
  he wants to teach his young daughter how to program.  Until today I had no idea
  that Gerry had any interest in modern boardgames.  Now I know.
