<p>Ken and I played <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/53953/thunderstone">Thunderstone</a> tonight.  Not run-of-the-mill standard Thunderstone, but <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/614361/anybody-know-about-the-variant-created-by-richard"><em>epic</em> Thunderstone</a>.  In the standard game you randomize the a fixed set of four hero classes, eight village cards, and three types of monsters in the dungeon.  In epic Thunderstone, you pull all of the 1st level characters out (I have the base game plus two expansions) and leave the level-ups in the box.  Shuffle them up and separate into four separate piles.  You never know what you're gonna get.</p>
<p>We loved it.  Makes a good game even better, especially for folks like me that don't play enough to see a wide variety of cards.  It also prevents games like I had with Jacob once where the village and character cards were not well suited for the dungeon.</p>
