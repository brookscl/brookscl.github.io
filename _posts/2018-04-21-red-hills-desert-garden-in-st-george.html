<p>We took a break from hiking (82 miles in the prior 7 days) and explored St. George Utah and saw a movie yesterday (Chappaquiddick). The highlight was visiting the amazing city park Red Hills Desert Garden, full of not just desert plants but some nice birdwatching as well. </p>
<p>Today we return to Zion to hike the Kolob Canyon region. We leave Utah tomorrow.</p>
