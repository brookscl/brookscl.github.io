excerpt: 'I decided to turn this post into a tutorial as well as a report on running
  a Kniziathon.  I suppose the idea could be transferable to any game designer with
  a significant library of games (Moonathon, Teuberathon, etc.), but it certainly
  helps having not on a large number of games in the collection but a wide range of
  lengths and depths of games. The first thing you need to do if running a Kniziathon
  is to check out Kevin Jacklin''s Kniziathon guide over at the Convivium.  This is
  where I learned everything I needed to know, and we were lucky enough to have Kevin
  in town to provide some friendly guidance along the way. Most of my preparation
  work involved preparing materials to provide on-site as well as for publication
  online and in the GameStorm program.  I''m including these materials online, so
  feel free to copy / revise /extend as you see fit.  Kniziathon Player Guide  Kniziathon
  Scoresheet  Kniziathon Placard  Kniziathon HQ Sign  I thought it was important to
  have an HQ area - somewhere to learn more about the Kniziathon, turn in scoresheets,
  and look for pickup games.  Jacob and I set this area up early on Friday morning,
  including a set of about 25 Knizia games from my personal collection.  I took a
  risk and allowed folks to use my games for pickup sessions without any sort of formal
  checkout process.  I put mailing return address labels in each box and didn''t have
  any wander away.  Hopefully they are all still complete!  I recruited a set of willing
  volunteers to man the HQ with me from 8am - midnight on Friday and 8am to 4pm on
  Saturday.  Despite several no-shows, this worked out fine and people were able to
  get the information they needed, play ad-hoc games, and turn in scoresheets with
  or without my personal presence.  Having Kevin around to teach and play games certainly
  helped.  KC and I ran the two-player all-Knizia tournament Friday night - a great
  way to increase participation in both the tournament and Kniziathon.  Having 20
  participants over 3 rounds produced around 25-30 scoresheets. After the tournament
  it was time for tabulation of the first day''s results, a process that took about 3-4
  hours and kept me up until 2am Saturday morning.  I used a custom database implemented
  in DabbleDB which made the process mostly easier - I say mostly, because the responsiveness
  of a web-based application can sometimes slow down the rapid data entry process
  I''m comfortable with.  Still, the app made tabulation and final scoring a snap.  Saturday
  was much easier - not as many scoresheet turn-ins, plus most of the players were
  already in the system so data entry only involved entering game scores and not new
  players.  Final tabulation took place from about 3:30pm to 4:30pm, giving me plenty
  of time to prepare for the awards ceremony with Reiner.  GameStorm donated a 2008
  registration, Maginor, Atlanteon, and Dragon Parade.  Reiner and Kevin showed up
  with three nicely designed trophies.  We didn''t have a prize or trophy explicitly
  for the youth winner (my own Jacob!), so it was nice having four available so that
  Jacob could choose first.  He chose Dragon parade.  It was a huge highlight for
  him to shake hands with Reiner and get a dollar bill signed by him.  The dollar
  bill was handed out to the players that tied for fourth overall after I said they
  "didn''t finish in the money" - Reiner quickly interrupted, reached into his wallet,
  and handed each player a dollar bill that he proceeded to autograph.  The winners
  were Tim Shippert, Tom Powers, and Zontziry Johnson (results are also posted over
  at the Convivium).  I was proud to be a part of this event.  Thanks to all of the
  volunteers that helped me out: KC, Ken, Doug, Jacob, George, Mike, Kevin, the GameStorm
  staff, and of course Reiner Knizia. '
