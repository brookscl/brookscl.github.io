excerpt: I'm having way too much fun with my Digital Rebel.  I'm especially impressed
  with the results I'm getting with high-speed (1/1600, 1/2000) action photos of Jacob
  and Matthew's baseball activity.  So bear with me if you are only interested in
  gaming activity - I'll probably be posting quite a few family photos this summer.         Jacob
  in the dugout with teammate Joey.  Focal length 80mm, F/4, 1/320 sec.           Jacob
  getting one his many hits on Saturday.  He had one of his best hitting days ever,
  reaching base every at bat over two games.  Focal length 300mm, F/7.1, 1/2000 sec.         Jacob
  is doing a great job as the backup catcher.  This is a photo of Jacob taking signs
  from the dugout coach that he will into ball position for the pitcher.  300mm, F/5.6,
  1/2000 sec.
