excerpt: I finally got around to posting some photos from my recent trip to Kuala
  Lumpur and Beijing.  Now that I'm using the Digital Rebel, the photos files are
  quite large.  Rather than trim them down and post them here, I'm going to try out
  the Ofoto service for a while.  When you click through the album links below, Ofoto
  will ask if you'd like to join.  You are not required to join to see the albums,
  so feel free to opt out.  Photos from Kuala Lumpur Photos from Beijing, including
  the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the Forbidden City.
