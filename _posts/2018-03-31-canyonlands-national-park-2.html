<p>We spent Friday afternoon at the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park. Similar to Dead Horse (they are situated in the same side of the same canyon), though it is larger and had a few distinct features. We hiked up a butte to a hidden granary suspected to be 1,000 years old. We were also greeted with complementary near-sunset views of the Colorado River canyon.</p>
