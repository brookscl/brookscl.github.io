excerpt: (Don't forget to check out my 2007 BGG.CON wrap-up) BGG.CON continues to
  impress and remains at the top of my list of conventions to travel to, surpassing
  Origins, Gen Con, and even Essen. Jim and I solved the food issue this year by always
  eating in at the hotel (despite many generous offers from those with vehicles!)
  and I fully expect to return next year. Already Own and Thrilled I Do Agricola -
  Deserves to be at the top of the geek. This will be the first longish game to make
  my dime list in a single year. After the Flood - This will be the game to play with
  my wargaming buddies when we have three people. Canal Mania - Evergreen game of
  canal building in the UK. A game I'm always willing to play and it gets better with
  time. Dominion - How will this hold up over time? Reports are that it is showing
  its age and may lack replayability. I'm still having a ball playing it. Race for
  the Galaxy - Renewed interest with the recent expansion will keep this in heavy
  rotation. Games I Played and Must Own Steam over Holland - Hard to come by but I'll
  keep hoping. Le Havre - I'm fairly certain this will get acquired soon - it should
  get more play this week at Mike's and then this coming weekend at Salishan. We the
  People - Technically I already have this on order (Washington's War) - hopefully
  the new version holds up with this classic. Chicago Express - High production quality
  combined with a solid game make this an easy decision. Battle for Hill 218 - Great
  two player abstract? wargame? - who cares, this is a fun game. Game I'll Need to
  Try Again Before I Buy Batavia - I'm worried that this is in the Thebes niche and
  won't get played as much as it should. Cities - Fun little game but will it grow
  old quickly? Municipium - Just didn't jump out at me and say "play me again!" Games
  I'm Glad I Tried But Won't Acquire Toledo - Lighter Wallace fair but not distinct
  enough from other similar games to hold my interest. Energie Poker - What can I
  say - I'm not a collector! Wealth of Nations - There are better games in this genre.
  Supernova - Partly because I'm not a big fan of multi-player sci-fi wargames, partly
  because there are better options out there when I feel like playing this sort of
  game. Comuni - Reminds me of a slightly deeper version of In the Year of the Dragon,
  and neither one is up my alley.
