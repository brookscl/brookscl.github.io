excerpt: Time for a few more family photos.  Julie and Matthew are in Reno for the
  weekend, so I'm spending each day shuttling Jacob to his baseball tournament out
  in Oregon City.  So far things are going great - Jacob's team went 3-0 in their
  pool play and play tomorrow afternoon for the tournament championship. Last Thursday
  evening Jacob had his annual school music program, so I'll post a few photos of
  that as well.         Part of Jacob's program was a bit of traditional folk/square
  dancing.         The boy is focused on his recorder play.         Not exactly an
  action baseball shot, but it underscores the fact that much of the time at these
  tourneys is spent waiting for the next game.
