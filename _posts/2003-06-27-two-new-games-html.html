excerpt: "                           Stopped by my friendly Rainy             Day
  Games store over lunch today to pick up two new games: Balloon             Cup and
  Quicksand.              I walked in planning to get just Balloon Cup (I played             it
  with Angela last month), but the owner gave such glowing remarks about Quicksand
  \            that I just had to pick it up.  Since it is such a new release, I’ll
  try             and write a review sometime over the next few weeks.               "
