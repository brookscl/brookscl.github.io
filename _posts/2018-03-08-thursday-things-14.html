I don’t use them anymore.”</li>
<li><a href="https://abe-winter.github.io/plea's/help/2018/02/11/slack.html">Slack is the opposite of organizational memory</a> – I’ve maintained for a while that tools like Slack have a place and value, but are a poor substitute for other collaboration tools like wikis and email.</li>

I expect to get out and play again this coming fall.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2trYnDh">The Fountainhead</a> (audio version) as I’ve heard it is “better” than Atlas Shrugged. It was moderately enjoyable but I’m not sure I would call it a classic.</li>
<li>I listened to <a href="http://amzn.to/2G73dsp">Hitler: Ascent, 1889–1939</a>, the best biography I’ve read to date. The account of the early 1930s Nazi takeover was masterfully done</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/04/26/401769240/first-listen-chris-stapleton-traveller">Chris Stapleton’s <em>Traveler</em></a> – this is the sort of country music I like.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/wood-brothers.html">The Wood Brothers’ <em>One Drop of Truth</em></a> – didn’t love it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/02/08/582669820/first-listen-the-low-anthem-the-salt-doll-went-to-measure-the-depth-of-the-sea">The Low Anthem’s <em>The Salt Doll Went To Measure The Depth Of The Sea</em></a> – I’ve been a fan for 10 years and this album doesn’t disappoint. This is spatial, theme music that for me will be good for relaxation and concentration. I think I wanted it to be more like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/10/31/6382494/the-decemberists-soar-with-crane-wife-live">The Crane Wife</a> with some driving anthems interwoven with their audio tapestries.</li>
</ul>
