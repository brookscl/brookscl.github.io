<p>I wrote <a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2020/06/28/the-year-of-less/">last year about my adoption of a yearly theme for 2020: The Year of Less</a>. Julie and I were in Florida for the new year celebration and cajoled my family into joining us for a collaborative wall-writing session on yearly themes. It went better than expected and was a nice moment of sharing and collective vulnerability. We just put up a few strips of wide paper on the wall and everyone took turns writing “on the wall.”</p>

<p>My theme for the year is <strong>Accountable Improvement</strong>. I have a few areas of focused self improvement I want to achieve in the year, and I want to rely more on outside help. The idea here is to heighten the accountability, and rely more on expert help. My tendency is to self-teach; this comes from a mix of self-confidence, self-reliance, and arrogance. I want to be more humble and open to others' ideas on how I can get better.</p>

<p>I jotted down some notes on what I want to stop/keep/start doing:</p>

<h3 id="stop">Stop</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Relying on myself for all tracking and intelligence for improvement</li>
<li>Confusing activity for progress</li>
<li>Avoiding difficult questions and plans regarding areas of improvement</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 id="keep">Keep</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Being diligent about practice time and calendar booking</li>
<li>Finding ways to measure performance</li>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 id="start">Start</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<ul>
<li>Looking for accountability partners in key areas of improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two improvement areas I’m primarily focused on at the start of the year: golf and German language. I started learning German via <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>. And because we are such nomads, I signed up for online digital golf coaching with <a href="https://evolvr.com/">evolvr</a>. My schedule has been a bit crazy of late (multiple trips between Texas and Florida) so I’m not making as much progress as I’d like, but I am seeing progress.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I’m also working to wrangle a few friends that know German into some online boardgaming where we’ll speak only German. I think (know) Duolingo will only take me so far and I need to be conversing a lot more. Worth considering too is <a href="https://www.italki.com/">italki</a> but I want to get my schedule a bit more cleared and consistent.</p>
