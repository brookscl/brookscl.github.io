excerpt: Friday was the kickoff day for our weekend gaming at Salishan with the Rude
  and Humphrey families.  That makes 13 bodies in all, so there are plenty of opportunities
  for a wide range of gaming.  Our goal is usually to bring out games we haven’t played
  yet or rarely get played in our normal sessions.  Here’s an example of the games
  with the potential of coming out this weekend.  I picked up Ra at BGG.Con in a trade
  with Keith Blume.  My first play of this was less than favorable, but given how
  popular the game is I figured I was missing something and took a chance on getting
  my own copy.  KC, Rita, Ken, and I sat down to play it as our first official game
  of the weekend.  KC and Rita have played this game quite a lot, but Ken and I were
  essentially playing for the first time so we took some time to learn/explain the
  rules.  I must admit the mechanics are very simple, the game is streamlined and
  easy to learn, and I quite enjoyed playing.  The fact that I edged out KC for the
  victory 44–42 might have something to do with it.  I really did enjoy the push-your-luck
  element combined with the auctions.  There’s a decent amount of luck in the game
  but that’s OK as you can take steps to mitigate this effect through the bidding
  process.  Julie and Justin committed themselves to resuming their speed duels. Justin
  tells me he’s up by three games now.  After our game of Ra, I suggested we try out
  the Sid Sackson classic Venture.  This is a copy I purchased on eBay from Sid’s
  personal collection.  Not a bad little game – there are some similarities to Acquire
  in that players build out corporations, there are takeover mechanics, etc., but
  the game certainly does stand on its own.  There were a few oddities in the rules
  that don’t make much sense – money from proxy battles goes to the bank, not the
  player you steal the corporation from.  Shouldn’t the money go to the player?  Also,
  as you run low in cards you get penalized even further, because if you can’t afford
  to buy anything you must discard a card.  I realize this is a mechanic intended
  to force players to keep cards in their hands, but it seems a bit harsh.  The game
  went on a bit longer than we would have liked, but it was enjoyable and might be
  worth trying again with some rules tweaks.  Justin, Josh, Rita, Julie, and I then
  played the SimplyFun game Plext, an interesting little word game that was challenging
  and fun.  You shuffle a set of 14 dice and reveal them arranged in a linear sequence. 
  Players are then challenged to come up with a series of words that use all of the
  letters in sequence order, inserting as many letters as needed.  For example, if
  the sequence was “EQRPI” then you might write down “EQuestRian PIe”.  As soon as
  a player thinks he has a competitive (small) number of words that use up all the
  letters, he can call out his bid (the number of words), puts down his pencil, then
  starts the timer.  The other players then have that much time to come up with their
  own bid, which can be any number of words.  When the timer runs out, whoever had
  the first lowest bid gets the first shot at solving.  If his solution was correct
  (valid words, used all the letters), he wins victory points totaling 10 minus the
  number of words.  Repeat for eight rounds to determine the winner.  While we were
  playing Plext, KC and Ken played a game of Jambo.  I think KC won.  We gave Barbarossa
  as a gift to the Rudes, so Julie, Jenna, Chelsea, and Brandon decided to give it
  a try.  Brandon says he enjoyed it very much, possibly influenced by the fact that
  he won.  KC was eager to pull out McMulti, one of those hard-to-find holy grail
  games that often goes for $200+ on eBay.  The game took us close to 3 hours to play
  and while it was enjoyable, it is a bit too much of a luckfest for my tastes, especially
  for a game that long.  There are some creative mechanics in the game, especially
  for a game from 1974.  My favorite is the cross-referenced die rolls that give production
  to the players on the right and left of the active player.  The economic system
  is pretty cool as well, though we played with a variant that throttles the economic
  cycle a bit.  KC, Ken, and I were all pretty close to each other, all surpassing
  the $1MM mark by the end of the game.  KC ended up the victor with Ken a close second.  Our
  last game of the night was partnership Tichu, Ken/Chris vs. KC/Rita.  This was my
  first time through a whole game of this, so it was nice to get the rules and basic
  strategy ingrained.  I’m ready to try again, especially to get a chance to avenge
  our loss to KC and Rita.  It was a close match with both teams close to 600, but
  they shut us down two hands in a row pulling out the victory.
