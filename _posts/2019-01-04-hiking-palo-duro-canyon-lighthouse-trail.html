<p>We did a 6 mile roundtrip hike in Palo Duro canyon, about 20 miles southeast of Amarillo. I first (and last) visited this canyon when I was in college, about 1986. I remembered how striking the contrast is as you leave the panhandle plains for the dramatic stratified canyon with hoodoos. It is less than 1000 feet deep but very long, also wide in places. This trail had a great payoff as we climbed up by the signature lighthouse hoodoos at the turnaround point.</p>
