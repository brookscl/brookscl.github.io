<p>Jacob, Matthew and I just finished a three player game.  I can see why people say this shines in multiplayer - the title selection and "who do I want to hurt" elements add so much more depth.  Jacob (playing Lannister) raced out to a quick lead over Matthew (Targaryen) and me (Stark), getting to 12 power before I wiped the board of all characters but one noble each for my opponents.  This stalled Jacob out long enough for Matthew and I to bring it closer but he still won with me at 12 and Matthew at 11 or 12.  Tight finish and very tense play.  The boys love it and are excited to see some more cards show up this week.</p>
