<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/steve-jobs-how-to-write-great-email.html">Steve Jobs Knew How to Write an Email. Here’s How He Did It</a> – A great decomposition of an email that Jobs wrote. Much to learn from this. My favorite comment: “This language is conversational, vulnerable, and paints the picture of Apple giving it their best shot, pursuing bias for action, and preparing to learn from any mistakes.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/us/politics/trump-afghanistan-war-elusive-victory.html">Attacks Reveal What U.S. Won’t: Victory Remains Elusive in Afghanistan</a> – How many times have we heard the same story: victory is just around the corner? This is Vietnam all over again: we know we can’t win, but we are too proud to walk away.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/understanding-how-design-thinking-lean-and-agile-work-together">Understanding how Design Thinking, Lean and Agile Work Together</a> – Good stuff here that I’ll be using in my Project Management Class.</li>
<li><a href="https://builttoadapt.io/a-letter-to-a-junior-engineer-edec0e260b87">Letter to a Junior Engineer</a> – I sent this to Jacob, of course.</li>
<li><a href="http://plan-pack-go.com/glamping-at-basecamp-37-perfectly-peaceful-and-perfectly-appointed/">Glamping at BaseCamp 37°: Perfectly Peaceful, and Perfectly Appointed</a> – Julie is writing again! We will be heading back to this part of the country in about 7 weeks.</li>
<li><a href="https://strenuouslife.co/">The Strenuous Life</a> – A merit badge program for manly men.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2nOaLIH">Coach the Person Not the Problem: A Simple Guide to Coaching for Transformation</a> as I’m trying to improve my approach to 1:1 professional coaching. On the one hand, I applaud the author for keeping the book short and too the point; no fluff here. On the other hand, I was craving more specific examples or stories on how to implement his ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0773DT1L4?ref=dm_sh_ovltcDfTzRWXnk4NmJC5cmN9X">“Out in the Open” by The Steep Canyon Rangers on Amazon Music</a> – This one showed up on a recommended list within the Amazon app and I enjoyed it. Bluegrassy / classic country.</li>
<li>I’ve been on a bit of a George Harrison kick (both playing on the guitar and listening), so of course I listened to <a href="https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00NIV73US?ref=dm_sh_5lNvvY1OcWVi6yqi46eGecyF5">“All Things Must Pass (Remastered)” by George Harrison on Amazon Music</a>. My favorite song of his to play right now is “If I Needed Someone.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Julie and I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27356643">Five Crowns</a> in one of our closest matches ever.</li>
<li><a href="http://area21.site">Doug</a> and I continued our Blitzkrieg in the West campaign in <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27383116">Advanced Squad Leader</a>, finishing the third-to-last scenario <a href="http://www.aslscenarioarchive.com/scenario.php?id=62740">BWN–4, Brush at Tilburg</a>.</li>
<li>We played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27389361">Tichu</a> with neighbors who are really starting to enjoy the game. Much fine Indian food and quite a lot of wine consumed.</li>
<li>During the Superbowl we played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27436221">Sunken Sailor</a>, a light adult party game (mucho adult language) that is more an activity than a game. Fun but not awesome.</li>
</ul>
