excerpt: " This report is almost a week late in coming, but better late than never. 
  Spent last week in North Carolina and Colorado, and I head to Vegas this week for
  a conference where I'll be speaking. Last Sunday a few folks came over for some
  casual gaming.  This wasn't a scheduled event so I was surprised at the strong turnout. 
  Peter, Ken, Brandon, Mike, Kevin, KC, Rita, and Jenna all joined us.  Brandon, Jacob,
  Matthew, and Jenna spent most of the time playing anything but boardgames. San Juan
  Kevin and Ken arrived first (Brandon went upstairs to play with the boys), so we
  quickly broke out San Juan, the card game based on the innovative boardgame Puerto
  Rico.  I had played with Jacob once before so had a decent handle on the rules;
  in any case, this is a very easy game to explain and learn. I got off to a strong
  start, getting a silver mine early and a few production/trading enhancement buildings. 
  It wasn't a very close game - I got to 12 buildings first and had a sizable advantage. 
  I'll attribute my victory to the fact that Ken and Kevin were just learning.         Chris
  and Ken playing San Juan. This is a quick, light, but fun game that I look forward
  to playing a lot in the future.  Looks like I even convinced a couple of co-workers
  to join me for a game over lunch next week! Pizzza While waiting for our game of
  San Juan to finish, KC, Rita, and Peter played a quick game of Pizzza, KC's light
  family game prototype.  Players are in pizza school and try to make the best pizzas. 
  This is a tile laying game with a bit of hidden objectives thrown in, and is a blast
  to play.         Peter, Rita, and KC playing Pizzza. Schrille Stille Schrille Stille
  plays great with 6, so that came out next.  This is not a game of deep strategy
  and if you can't handle a bit of chaos, say away from this game.  Boy, is this game
  fun!  Even after the amusement of the voting mechanism wears off, there is some
  serious tension as the game draws to an end.  We had lead changes on all four of
  the final scoring rounds, with players bouncing from last to first and back again
  over the course of two turns.  I think Kevin came out on top this time.         Peter
  and Ken place their votes in Schrille Stille. This game truly is a party game, and
  would be welcome with most casual or even non-gamers in my opinion. Ticket to Ride
  Several folks wanted to play Ticket to Ride, so we broke that one out.  Mike Deans
  showed up about the same time, and we had 6 people and had to split things up a
  bit (Peter had to go).  Kevin, Ken, Rita, and KC played Ticket to Ride while Mike
  and I decided to learn and try Blue Moon.         Ken, Kevin (the unknown gamer),
  Rita, and KC play Ticket to Ride. I think everyone was feeling good about this game. 
  I certainly look forward to playing it again. Blue Moon Mike and I decided to play
  Blue Moon out of the box.  The rules are straightforward, and if you are familiar
  with combat-oriented CCGs you will pick up this game quickly.  Blue Moon is not
  a collectable card game though - it has a base set with expansions (and more due
  this year), but there's no notion of rarity, booster packs, etc. Each player represents
  a faction at war with each other.  On a turn, a player will always play a character
  to duel against the opponent's character.  Each character has a specified strength
  in earth and fire, so when you lay down a character you must declare the element
  in which the character will fight. The opponent must either respond in kind with
  a character at least as strong as the opponent's character, or retreat.  When a
  player retreats, the other player wins a dragon to his side.  Three dragons start
  out the game in the center (neutral) space.   If a player can win all of the dragons
  plus one to his side, he automatically wins the game.  Dragons only live on one
  side or the either, so when you win a dragon and the opponent already has one or
  more on his side, one of those dragons just moves back to the neutral space. There
  are other optional cards that can be played with the characters: leadership cards
  are use-once in nature and give a benefit usually unrelated to the character (like
  allowing the player to draw more cards).  Booster and support cards usually improve
  the character currently played or limit the opponent's actions in some way.         Mike
  plays Chris in Blue Moon while Jacob watches on. If a player runs out of cards or
  cannot play a character from his hand when he must, then he automatically loses
  the hand.  This is the way all of our hands ended, so clearly card management is
  a key part of the game. This is a fun game that I hope to play some more.  I'm not
  sure if it is significantly more compelling than playing, say, the latest pre-constructed
  starter decks for Magic: the Gathering, but there are some nice differences.  First,
  the artwork is extremely nice. Second, the cards are much larger (probably twice
  as big in area) giving it a different feel.  The gameplay is also a bit simpler
  in that there seem to be fewer timing issues. Liar's Dice While waiting for the
  Blue Moon game to finish, the rest of the crowd played a shortened game of Liar's
  Dice.         I think Jenna was down to her last die at this point, but she still
  seems happy! Mexica I can't remember how this one turned out, but I do know that
  everyone enjoyed the game.  I haven't played it so look forward to giving this one
  a try at some point.         Ken, Kevin (the arm), and Rita play Mexica. Base Camp
  Delta The last game of the day for me was KC's latest prototype, Base Camp Delta. 
  The theme is pretty cool here - mountain climbers trying to reach the summit of
  Mt Everest and the other peaks surrounding it in the Himalayas.         Mike, KC,
  and I play Base Camp Delta. This is a racing game but with a few twists.  Teamwork
  is key here, and in the spirit of cooperation of climbing teams, even your opponents
  climbers will help yours. So when climbing, it helps to have others above you and
  with you to facilitate those tricky stretches.          Close-up of the board in
  Base Camp Delta.  Note the tokens representing hidden values for the different peaks.
  There's a certain press your luck element to this game - climbs are attempted with
  dice rolls (d10) and checked against a difficulty scale based on the terrain, plus
  any bonuses from helping hands and cards played.  Each climber can make two climbs
  per turn (a player has 5 climbers), but as soon as a single climber fails, the turn
  is over.  If you manage to finish a turn without a failed climb, you get to draw
  an extra card. Those that dislike dice rolling games may cringe when they see a
  game like this.  If you like Formula De or other racing games, but want to include
  some other mechanics such as surprise objectives and resource management, then you'll
  probably enjoy this game."
