excerpt: 'I arrived in Melbourne about 10am Saturday morning after about 18 hours
  total flying time.  Things sure have changed since the last time I was here: I had
  to rent a phone for the week to be able to affordably stay in contact with folks
  at home.  Now, my Blackberry works: phone, email, browser and all.  I was able to
  call Julie within 5 minutes of landing here as if it were a local call. One key
  to recovering from jetlag when traveling to Australia (and arriving in the morning)
  is to stay awake the first day and switch to a local timetable.  I made a mistake
  last time I was in Sydney and took a nap in the afternoon - this lead to repeated
  awakenings in the night and another day of recovery.  So, my colleague and friend
  Mike and I set out to explore downtown north of the Yarra River.  What follows is
  a short photo journal of our day.         We started the day with a short walk to
  Flinders Street Railway Station.  We had lunch and a beer across the street at Young
  and Jackson''s.         Next we hiked west and rode to the top of Rialto Tower to
  check out the Melbourne observation deck.  The views were stunning - clear, beautiful
  day with plenty of visibility.  Here you can see (upper left) the Melbourne Cricket
  Ground and (middle right) the National Tennis Centre, home of the Australian Open.         Ahhh,
  a little slice of home.         So we''re wandering down Swanston St when I happen
  to gaze across the street - lo and behold, a game store!  Mind Games is a nice store
  - emphasis on family board games with a HUGE selection.  I probably would have bought
  something if the prices had been more reasonable.  I suspect they were 20% higher
  than retail in the US.  I did buy 5 wooden d6.         While walking back to the
  hotel, we happened by a wedding at the Scots Church.  Very cool bagpipes - how can
  you resist stopping and having a listen?'
