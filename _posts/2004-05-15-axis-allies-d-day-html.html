excerpt: 'Friday evening Jacob and I started our first game of Axis & Allies: D-Day,
  a game that we managed to finish tonight after his baseball game.  Jacob played
  the Allies (USA and UK) while I took on the role of the Axis.         Jacob looking
  at the initial board setup. The game starts furiously with Allied paratroopers dropping
  in to start the game, followed by shore bombardments and the first amphibious assault. 
  Action is non-stop with little opportunity to avoid combat given the 10 turn time
  limit on the Allies.         Thank you Hasbro for not making me take all of these
  pieces off the plastic trees.  The game comes ready to play, though like most I
  was missing a few pieces (1 German tank, 1 UK infantry, 1 extra German infantry).
  The order of the each turn is managed through Order Cards, which are turned over
  in succession each turn to call out the phases.  This is a nice system if a bit
  tedious at times, though by removing cards that are no longer relevant as the game
  moves things start moving very quickly.  Our first game lasted about 2 - 2.5 hours,
  but I suspect we will get it down to 90 minutes pretty easily.         These Americans
  look ready to storm the beach. This game is not for those who prefer to avoid dice
  rolling - as with any A&A game, dice rolling is a major part of the game and can
  unwind even the greatest of plans.  For my kids this is considered a bonus because
  it can also be a great equalizer. One great component of this game is the use of
  patrol fighter aircraft that the Allied player can position on the board.  These
  units do not attack like ground units, but rather wait for Axis ground units to
  move into our out of thier region.  When they do, the aircraft get a shot at each
  unit moving, rolling a single d6 and eliminating that unit on a 1.  At one point
  Jacob rolled 4 consecutive 1''s, eliminating 4 of my tanks. As I found in my playtesting,
  this game appears to be very well balanced with tons of tension throughout the game. 
  The Allied player needs to capture three towns and hold them for a complete turn
  before the 10th turn ends, meaning they must capture by the 9th.  While Jacob was
  routinely destroying my forces, he lost track of time and around turn 7 he realized
  his time crunch and starting getting more determined to achieve his victory conditions. 
  Unfortunately for him St. Lo was too hotly contested and he was unable to extinguish
  my troops there in time to claim victory.  After the game I gave him some advice
  on how to slow down my troops, use his tanks more effectively (the can move two
  regions per turn), and concentrate his forces a bit more effectively.         Final
  battle at St. Lo - the Axis are victorious. This game will come out frequently,
  and will be a perfect 3-player light wargame to play with Matthew and Jacob.  If
  you are a fan of the A&A series but don''t often have time for a full game, consider
  picking this one up.'
