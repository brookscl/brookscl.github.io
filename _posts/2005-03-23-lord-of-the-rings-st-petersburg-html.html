excerpt: 'I periodically do bulk game orders for my local group through Boards and
  Bits, my favorite online retailer.  This works reasonably well, though with my work
  and travel schedule lately it has been a challenge to deliver all of the games to
  my group.  Chuck and I arranged for him to stop by on his way home from work in
  Wilsonville tonight, and as long as he is stopping by why not play some games?       Originally
  we had planned on 2p games as I was expecting Julie and the boys to stay out at
  the coast all week.  They came back mid day and Matthew was around, so we let Matthew
  choose a game off the shelf.  His all-time favorite is the Lord of the Rings boardgame,
  a cooperative game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chuck
  (Frodo), Matthew (Sam), and I (Pippin) battle Sauron.                                                                                        The
  stars were aligned tonight (read: somebody must have stacked the event tile deck)
  because we sailed through Moria, Helms Deep, Shelob''s Lair, and Mordor in an almost
  effortless fashion.  Our family''s previous high score was 79 (60 for destroying
  the ring plus 19 shield points) and we blew that record away tonight with a score
  of 88.      We had about an hour left and Chuck had never played St. Petersburg,
  so that was a logical choice.  This game is still top shelf for me - plays quickly,
  is easy to teach, and plenty of tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Matthew

  picked up on the mechanics and strategy quickly, made great choices and pulled out
  the victory in the end.'
