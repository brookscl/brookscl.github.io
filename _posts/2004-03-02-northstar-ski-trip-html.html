excerpt: I'm back after one my longer absences from posting.  If you aren't family
  or interested in our ski trip, you can probably skip this one!  Back to gaming in
  a few. Julie, Jacob, Matthew, and I flew down to Reno two weekends ago to join Julie's
  two brothers and sister for a short ski week at Tahoe.  Two years ago we stayed
  in south Tahoe for a week and skied Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, Kirkwood,
  and Northstar.  We enjoyed Northstar so much on that trip that we decided to stay
  there for the whole week this time.  Northstar has a great mid-week package at their
  village that gives two daily lift tickets for each room occupied, so it was also
  very affordable.        Mike, Jacob, Matthew, Lisa, Julie, and David prepare for
  our first day of skiing. Conditions on day 1 were great.  The snow wasn't very fresh,
  but the weather was fairly warm and the sky was clear.  We hung together as a group
  for most of the morning.  After lunch, Mike, Dave and I headed to the back side
  for some harder skiing.        Getting ready to head out on the east ridge.  You
  can see Lake Tahoe in the background. In the afternoon our (lack of) conditioning
  became very apparent.  The back side is where Northstar shines.  This is where the
  bulk of the black diamonds are; not as difficult as many ski mountains, but plenty
  long and diverse enough terrain to keep things interesting.  Our favorite part of
  the back side are the groves of widely spaces trees.  Plenty of ungroomed powder
  and it forces more consistent turning.        Mike takes a laying rest in the snow
  on the back side. After three or four hard runs we were pretty tired though, so
  we headed back to the condo for some r&r.        Dave takes a breather. Much of
  the time back at the condo was spent reading, watching movies, and playing some
  lighter games.  Dave brought Call of Duty for Mike to try, so he spent much of his
  time immersed in that great first-person WWII game.        Mike enjoying Call of
  Duty. On Tuesday, Jacob, Matthew, Dave, and I decided to give snowboarding a try. 
  For Dave and I it had been 10 years (our trip to Steamboat) since our last attempt. 
  For Jacob and Matthew it was their first try.  They are both very strong skiers
  for their age, able to ski easier black diamonds and very comfortable on just about
  any blue slope.        Jacob and Dave in the gondola heading to their snowboarding
  lesson. Jacob and Matthew joined a youth lesson while Dave and I took an adult beginner
  lesson.  This turned out to be a mistake, since Dave and I picked up the basics
  very quickly and spent most of the class watching the instructor teach the other
  three how to slide and do basic edge turns.        Matthew with a positive outlook
  on his day of snowboarding. The lessons lasted until about 12:45, so we had some
  lunch then decided to take the boys on their first lift (a bunny slope).  That went
  well so we got on the high speed quad to try a longer green run.  This turned out
  to be a mistake.  Matthew wasn't quite ready for such a long run, and he had some
  tough falls.  He tends to be pretty aggressive and got going a bit too fast a few
  times and couldn't keep his balance.  So after one run, Matthew was done so we took
  the gondola down and called it a day.        Dave and Mike experiencing some of
  the deeper, fluffier stuff. On Wednesday we started to get some serious snow.  Winds
  were strong, visibility was low, and snow was falling hard.  The mountain was about
  to get over four feet of snow over the next 36 hours.  In general this is a good
  thing, but while the snow is falling it make things challenging, especially with
  the kids.  Most of the group quit pretty early on Thursday, but Dave, Mike, and
  I spent some quality time on the back side in the new powder.  We got worn out quickly
  so retired around 2pm.        Waiting for the bus on the final ski day.  Matthew,
  Mike, Jacob, Lisa, Dave, Julie, and Chris. The snow was still falling hard on Thursday,
  and around 8:30am or so we headed to the bus stop to catch the shuttle.  The power
  had gone out in our condo about 15 minutes earlier, but we didn't really give it
  a second thought.  Turns out the power was down on the entire mountain, causing
  some transportation issues.  First, the shuttle didn't show up for about 40 minutes. 
  Second, the gondola was shut down indefinitely.  Finally, the backup lift wouldn't
  start operating for another 45 minutes or so.  Of course all of the mid-mountain
  lifts were running just fine.  Makes perfect sense.  Dave and Lisa had planned to
  take the day off anyway (with Matthew), and Jacob and Julie gave up after waiting
  for the gondola for a while.  The weather was getting colder and windier.  So it
  was down to just Mike and me.        Mike after one of his many spectacular powder
  crashes.  Fortunately it was soft. Visibility was low again, but the skiing was
  fantastic.  The power issues prevented us from heading to the back side, but we
  had plenty of fun skiing the deep powder off the Vista lift.  I'm not a seasoned
  powder skier, and I don't have powder skis, but it was an adventure and I was able
  to work on my technique.  Fortunately I didn't lose any skis in the process. Overall
  it was a great trip.  We managed to work in four plays of Bang! with the High Noon
  expansion, a few plays of Attribute, one game of Too Many Cooks, and a fun round
  of Electronic Catch Phrase.
