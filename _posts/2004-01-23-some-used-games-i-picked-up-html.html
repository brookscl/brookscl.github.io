excerpt: 'I checked out Greg Aleknevicus'' Games for Sale list and found a few things
  I wanted for a reasonable price - plus he was having a buy 2 get 1 free sale!  So
  this is what I ordered; they arrived yesterday and I hope to play at least two of
  them over the weekend:  Amazing Labyrinth - this sounded like a great, light kids
  game that the family would enjoy. Quebec 1759 - I''m becoming a sucker for those
  Columbia Games block games. I''m fairly certain this was the first block game published
  - this guy apparently agrees.  This one came out in 1972, and the version I got
  is the original.  Chris Farrell put together a nice “best of“ geeklist for Columbia
  Games. Tally Ho - Another of the Kosmos two-player small box games.  This was effectively
  my “free“ game.  Haven''t tried it yet, but reviews are mostly favorable.'
