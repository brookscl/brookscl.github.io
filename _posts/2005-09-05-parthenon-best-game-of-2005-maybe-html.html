excerpt: 'After returning from the coast this afternoon, Ken and Brandon joined Jacob
  and me for a four-player game of Parthenon: Rise of the Aegean.  Here’s a combined
  session report and review about a game I hope to play quite a bit more in the coming
  weeks. Parthenon, published by Siren Bridge Publishing and marketed by Z-Man Games, caught
  me by surprise when I first encountered the game at GenCon 2005 – it wasn’t on my
  “check it out” list because I had no forewarning of its publication.  My experience
  playing a few turns with Rick Thornquist, Valerie Putman, and co-designer Jason
  Hawkins was strong enough to warrant an immediate purchase. Most of the components
  in this game are cards – 440 of them to be exact.  Each player takes the part of
  an island in the Aegean Sea struggling to take an important role in the Greek empire. 
  Each island has a custom play mat showing the buildings that player needs to build
  in order to win the game – no two islands are exactly the same, differing primarily
  in the basic and rare commodities produced on that island but also in some of the
  optional buildings that can be built.  The central game board is used only as a
  guide to the different islands to which players can travel – most of the action
  happens in front of each player around his respective play mat.    (from BoardGameGeek)
  Each island has its own build deck with cards representing all of the buildings
  and fleets that can be constructed by that island, as well as a quick reference
  card and Archon card (more on that later).  The islands specialize in the sorts
  of commodities that can be produced there, resulting in some interesting balance
  mechanisms when played with different numbers of players.  There are three core
  islands used for any number of players, with a fourth player we chose randomly from
  the remaining three.  Because the addition of the fourth island adds some overlapping
  commodity production, the fourth island plus the other two players that match up
  commodity-wise with the fourth island get some bonuses at the start to compensate
  for the reduced value of their commodities (increased supply —> reduced value, economics
  y’know). The mechanic for building out the card is as expected – you produce commodities
  yourself, but not the right types to do everything you need to do.  Trading is required,
  and players trade with each other as well as by traveling to nearby and distant
  lands.  Better deals can be found in the foreign lands, but trips across the Med
  are fraught with risk.  Players can mitigate these risks in a number of ways, including
  bringing along armies or warships, pleasing the gods, and building wonders or adopting
  philosophies that grant special powers. The game lasts for three years of four seasons
  each or until the end of a season when a player has built all of his required buildings,
  whichever comes first.  Our game lasted exactly three hours including instruction
  and finished after the 1st season in the third year.  We played with the optional
  forgiving beginner variant that takes away some of the bad event cards that can
  hamper early development.  The core mechanic in this game is trading, but to be
  successful a player must plan for a wide range of risks that can often distract
  the player from achieving the ultimate goal of completing all of his buildings. 
  There are also opportunities to exploit the current economic situation on the board
  – we found the commodity shortages in certain ports to be extremely lucrative for
  players that produced those commodities, especially if they came out early in the
  year.  We did not find this to be un-balancing though, as there seems to be a decent
  mix of events and harbor effects that distribute well across each of the islands.
  There has been some criticism of this game, claiming that it is yet another multi-player
  solitaire game.  We didn’t find that at all, with frequent trading, plenty of strategy
  discussion and positioning, and some interesting application of the Archon mechanic. 
  At the end of each season, all of the players vote for a player to become the new
  Archon (you can’t vote for yourself).  The Archon resolves all order-of-play issues,
  which includes the order in which seasonal events take place as well as the order
  in which players reveal their actions.  This is important because in each of the
  10 phases of the seasons, players act simultaneously.  In most phases order doesn’t
  matter, but in a few it can make a difference so the Archon role is meaningful. 
  In one case, the Archon had decide the order of several season events where the
  order could make the difference between a couple of players keeping most or losing
  all of their commodities.  A well-placed tribute to the Archon helped the events
  to be resolved in a beneficial order (though he was under no obligation to do so,
  even after the “tribute”). Why does this game work?  I’ll give a few reasons why
  we all gave it high marks after our first complete play:  Very little, almost zero
  downtime.  For a game that lasts 2–3 hours, this is a huge benefit. Minimal direct
  confrontation between players.  This won’t be a positive attribute for everyone,
  but in games with mixed adults and kids this can be a good thing. Civilization /
  RTS feel.  We love playing real-time strategy games on the computer, and this game
  shares a lot with that genre, especially Age of Mythology (but without the combat
  of course).  Players build wonders that grant special powers, adopt philosophies,
  harvest commodities to construct buildings, etc. Tension.  There’s plenty of it
  in this game.  What event will come up next season?  Am I prepared for it?  Do I
  take a shot at traveling to Egypt this season to get that much-needed Papyrus, or
  do I wait a season until I build a warship to provide some extra protection? Balanced
  assymetry.  This isn’t unique to this game, but I think the designers did a nice
  job of balancing the different islands and providing handicapping when playing with
  four or five players.  This helps force trading even between players competing for
  the lead. There are some similarities between Parthenon and the limited release
  Antiquity from Splotter Spellen.  If that sort of game interests you, you owe it
  to yourself to try this one out.  Plus, you can finish a game of Parthenon in less
  than three hours (try that with Antiquity…)!  I’ll be sure to revise my thoughts
  on the game if my feelings change after subsequent plays, but for now it is safe
  for me to say that this is my favorite game so far in 2005.'
