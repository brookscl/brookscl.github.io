excerpt: Later today (it is Friday early morning right now), the four of us will pack
  up the car and head back to central Oregon (La Pine, to be specific), this time
  for Jacob's weekend baseball tournament (schedule here, White Sox division).  This
  will be a nice break - we haven't had time like this together as a family for a
  while, and his schedule is such that we should get some time to explore on Saturday
  morning.  I'll take plenty of photos of course.
