excerpt: 'Things are not looking good.  A bulk purchase of games at Funagain combined
  with a lack of playing time over the summer has really set me back on my quest to
  play all of my unplayed games in 2006.  One of the first steps to recovery is admitting
  you have a problem, so let me just say it – without some other changes, I don’t
  think I can complete this project in 2006.  Time for some drastic action. There
  are two changes I can make to get into recovery mode:  Get more aggressive about
  knocking out the unplayed games. Get rid of games on the unplayed list that likely
  wouldn’t stay in my collection anyway. I’ve chatted with a few friends like Ken
  and KC about hosting a burndown party at my house – this is gaming where we focus
  on quantity, not quality.  Maybe I’ll give points to people that show up to help
  me knock down the list and do some weighted raffle prizes or the like.  Given that
  we are entering football season and my Saturdays will be shot September-October,
  I may need to set aside a Sunday to do this. The second bullet is more interesting
  to me and is where I think I can get more help from you, the reader.  I’m going
  to list all of the games I own but have yet to play, and I’d like those of you with
  opinions to post a comment with a list of 5–10 games that you think I should dump
  from my collection.  Checkers 2000 Dying Lights Fast Golf Golden Deuce Himalaya
  Blackjack Key-Cue QUITS 1830 - Railroads and Robber Barons Battlestations Diplomacy
  History of the World Starship Catan Britannia Corsairs and Hellcats Iron Dragon
  Silverton Kingdoms Crystal of Power, The - DragonLords El Caballero Loco! Maelstrom
  (a Vortex game) Manifest Destiny Mag-Blast Second Edition Master Labyrinth Hellas
  Cave Troll Robert Heinlein''s Starship Troopers Orient Express Hero Clix Cannes
