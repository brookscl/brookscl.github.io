excerpt: 'Looks like there is a decent likelihood of an English language reprint of
  Die Macher.  Valley Games, a publisher startup in Alberta, appears to be running
  a P500–style ordering process for the game.  Unfortunately the store is closed so
  there’s no way to place orders yet. From their website: Yes, the rumors are true.
  Valley Games is in the process of bringing the gaming community the only top ten
  game yet to be reprinted in English. This international reprint will have rules
  written in English, German, French and Spanish. The boards, tiles and cards have
  all been redesigned to be language independent. I hope they can pull this off. 
  Die Macher has been on my to-get list for some time.'
