<p>We are out at the Oregon Coast doing some work to get our house sold (finally... we hope). There are been some king tides this winter and it is having a devastating effect. Several coastal homes have had serious damage, like logs and water coming up over their decks. We canâ€™t even walk down to the beach anymore from our property.</p>
