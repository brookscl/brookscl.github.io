excerpt: 'My friend Mike Deans was kind enough to open his household for a day of
  gaming with a rather large crowd.  All four us joined the crew from Rip City Gamers. 
  Oh yeah, I heard there was a football game on two. Since it is late Sunday and I''m
  traveling all week, I will post the report with less than my usual game commentary
  - mostly photos with a few editorial comments.        Things got started bright
  and early with a game of Triple Crown, with the side betting variant.  KC pulled
  out the victory.          KC and the boys play some four player free-for-all Magic:
  the Gathering.          Several of us were eager to bring out Attika.  This was
  my first 4-player game, and I like it less than 2 or 3.  Too much downtime.          The
  final Attika board.  I (red) was fighting a two-front war.  George (blue) worked
  his way to my home temple with a great final turn move.  I should have worked harder
  to stop him.          The group plays a seven-player game of Bang!  I heard that
  the renegade won, the first time I''ve seen this happen.          The young women
  join the fun with Star Wars: Epic Duels.          I was able to play Knizia''s Africa,
  a decent exploration game.  This would be a fun family game, but I wasn''t thrilled.
           We all got to play Loopin'' Louie for the first time.  Matthew quickly
  learned the touch and did very well.          Several of us wanted to try Logistico,
  so KC brought it out and taught us.  He was hesitant to play with five players,
  and I can see why.  I bit too much chaos, and I got really hosed when I confused
  the medium brown with the slightly darker brown wooden pieces.  I would like to
  play this again with 2 or 3 players.          KC and I taught Julie and Ken Alhambra. 
  For a game I don''t like very much, I sure have been playing it a lot!  OK, maybe
  I do like it just a little.  This was my first win in this game.          KC taught
  us Too Many Cooks, a light card game by Knizia. This a great filler and everyone
  enjoyed it.  I even managed to win.          Metro came out again.          My last
  game of the evening was Coloretto, a new card game that has come out quite a bit
  this weekend.  I''m enjoying this more and more with each play.          We did
  watch the game every once in a while.  Great finish.'
