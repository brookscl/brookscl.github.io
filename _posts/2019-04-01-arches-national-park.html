<p>I've been remote for the past 5-6 days without signal. Time for more updates. I've got about five more to go.</p>
<p>Our focus this trip isn't the big national parks (other than Grand Canyon) but we were camping so close to Arches that we dropped in for two evening hikes.</p>
<p>This photo is the courthouse towers. The Park Avenue hike along them is easy and very scenic.</p>
