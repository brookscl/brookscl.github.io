excerpt: 'GameSpy has a pretty humorous interview of Stephen Colbert (of Daily Show
  fame) relating his experiences playing Dungeons & Dragons as a youth.  He got into
  the game about the same time I did.  Favorite quote:  I had an eleventh-level paladin
  (it took me years to advance those levels) whom I took on Expedition, and he got
  the Power Armor, which was the big thing to get in that module. But he also went
  a little power mad. On the next campaign we saw merchant caravans crossing the desert,
  and my character flew down and landed next to a merchant and tore off the guy''s
  head.  The DM informed me that I was not a paladin anymore.  I said, "Oh, shit,
  I forgot. I''m lawful good!"  DM: "Yeah, and the gods are angry. So you''re not
  a paladin anymore. You can start again as anything you want, but that character''s
  done."'
