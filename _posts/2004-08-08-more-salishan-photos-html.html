excerpt: I've had a few requests from family and friends for more pictures of the
  house in Salishan.  We were able to spend the weekend there again, doing some more
  work on the house, getting estimates on flooring, and having some fun.  Matthew
  and I played the golf course Saturday night, our first time playing there.  We took
  advantage of their twilight rates and raced around as fast as we could, getting
  in 11 holes in under 2 hours.  Sunday morning Jacob and I took the canoe out on
  Siletz Bay, taking advantage of the high tide to get a bit further towards the river. 
  The weather was fantastic - no wind and crystal-clear water.  We could see Dungeness
  crabs running sideways (how else would they run?) away from the canoe, harbor seals,
  and of course amazing shore and sea birds.         Another view of the deck. This
  portion has eastern exposure and overlooks the bay.         The elevator has this
  really cool, almost functional weathervane on it.         Last weekend we had a
  beach fire Saturday night to celebrate Matthew's 8th birthday.         This weekend
  we brought up a table and chairs that my boss found for us at a garage sale.  They
  need some work, but were a steal at $15.          Last weekend we rented a trailer
  and brought up one of our beds so we'd have a place to sleep, and our picnic table
  to place on the western side of the house.  This area gets great afternoon sunlight
  and offers a spectacular view of the ocean.
