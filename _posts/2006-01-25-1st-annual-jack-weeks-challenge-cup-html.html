excerpt: It has been almost a year since I posted anything about the chess program
  I run at Archer Glen elementary here in Sherwood.  We just kicked off tournament
  season and had a warm-up session last week during school with the two other Sherwood
  elementary schools at the local YMCA.  Chess is a big deal in Sherwood, largely
  through the efforts of Jack Weeks, retired school counselor who initiated the chess
  programs in the local schools.  It therefore seemed appropriate to award the Jack
  Weeks Challenge Cup to the school that wins the tournament each year.  I ran the
  tournament team swiss style and we managed to squeeze in seven rounds between 9am
  and 2am.  I was only able to attend until about 10:45am, but we had more than ample
  adult support on hand to keep things running smoothly.  Jacob and Matthew both had
  solid days, scoring in the 3–4.5 point range.  One of Jacob’s best games was a match
  against Hopkins Elementary’s best player – you can see the endgame below where they
  squared off with K/R and two pawns each.  Jacob got his rook lured into a trap in
  the back corner and lost it, leading to a loss in a well-spirited game.  Matthew
  did very well and finished in the top 3 for third graders.  This is his third year
  playing in the tournament circuit and should be a powerhouse by the time he hits
  the fifth grade.  Archer Glen pulled out the team victory as well as the top 2 individual
  players.  This coming Saturday is the big regional Chess for Success tournament. 
  If we can pull out a 1st or 2nd place at regionals then we’ll advance to the state
  championship.
