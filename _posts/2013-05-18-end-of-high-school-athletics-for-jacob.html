<em>Jacob frosh football</em></p>
<p>Today  marks the end of Jacob's high school athletic career as Julie, Matthew and I watched him compete at  Putnam HS for the district track meet (he took 6th in javelin). Forgive me if I use a few words here to brag about Jacob's athletic history in high school.</p>

<em>Jacob frosh basketball</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Jacob played every season, every year in high school.  Football, basketball, and track for four seasons.</li>
<li>He was a team captain for each of his senior seasons, plus a track captain for his junior year.</li>
</ul>

<em>Jacob frosh track</em></p>
<ul>
<li>My data may not be 100% accurate, but I think he lost only one football game during four years of high school. He completed a frosh undefeated season, a JV undefeated season (plus some varsity time during an undefeated state championship season), a junior year that ended with a single loss in the state championship, and an undefeated senior season with a state championship.</li>
<li>First team all conference in football, first team all-state tight end his senior year</li>
</ul>

<em>Jacob senior year football</em></p>
<ul>
<li>After nearly quitting basketball after his sophomore year, he dedicated himself to being a role player with hustle and strong defensive skills. He missed most of his junior season with a broken ankle but returned for his senior year to be a key 6th man on the varsity team.</li>
</ul>

<em>Jacob senior year basketball</em></p>
<ul>
<li>He focused on just javelin for his senior year and <a href="http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=1901975">improved his PR to over 160'</a> which should be competitive enough for him to throw at Carnegie Mellon next season (should he decide to do so)</li>
