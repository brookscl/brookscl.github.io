<p>Today I leave Keuka Lake for my return west and start of football season. Always bittersweet leaving here (mostly on the bitter side this year), though a nice bonus is I get to spend a full day with Jacob in California this weekend. Within a year or two I expect to be able to stay through mid to late September and not be apart from Julie for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>We had some new visitors this summer, plus spent a lot more time with our neighbors in the cóvè. Here are some photos of our latest guests and antics with neighbors, such as birthday parties when there aren't birthdays.</p>
