excerpt: 'Julie just wrote this tid-bit to me about our games class.  I''m out of
  town on business all week so she''s handling both classes, and we struggled a bit
  deciding what to do.  We are nearing the end of the class and I hope to try Bohnanza
  but am still a bit concerned about complexity.  We decided to pull out Werewolf
  and it was a smash hit:  Yup…Werewolf got 4’s across the board. And that’s after
  I tried to clean it up and give it an “E for Everyone” rating. I gave some background
  about how in the old days, people didn’t know as much about their world and when
  strange things happened, they often resorted to superstition. In the updated story,
  we said someone ‘disappeared’ in the night. Villagers woke up and had to blame someone
  since people don’t just disappear. They chose someone to lock in jail (not lynch).
  Once the round was over, I always went back to the werewolves (who weren’t really
  werewolves) and asked them why they were taking people. The explanations were cute
  – I was hungry and needed someone to cook for me, I was bored and we were playing
  games, etc. I think it was important to make the change. Even while playing this
  version, a couple in my group said it was scary since they had to close their eyes
  and they didn’t know if they’d be ‘taken away’. The more they played it, the better
  they were. I don’t think they fully understood my role as moderator at first (no
  one physically is taken anywhere, etc.). Both groups had a ball and didn’t even
  notice when it was 7:45 and time to leave. Awesome.'
