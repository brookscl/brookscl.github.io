<p>Soon we depart for our first big family trip since our <a href="http://www.chrisbrooks.org/blog/2008/7/12/europe-2008-summary.html">Europe trip almost exactly three years ago</a>. A year ago we were set on heading to Greece for spring break 2011 but Julie and I decided we'd rather hit the islands there when the weather was warmer.  Julie did some exploring and offered up Galapagos as an option -- how could I say no?</p>
<p>This trip Julie did all the legwork, choosing <a href="http://www.columbusecuador.com/">Columbus Travel</a> after researching a number of options.  Travel to the islands is very constrained - while you can get to the island on your own, moving around the islands is best done on a full-featured cruise.  After much discussion amongst ourselves and travel companions Dave and Lisa we settled on the <a href="http://www.athalacruise.com/athala_galapagos/index2.html">Athala</a>.  The catamaran style should keep it more stable (and sea-sickness free, mostly) in the open water, and the itinerary hits the key spots we want to see.</p>

<p>I'm certainly not ready to give an endorsement to Columbus Travel or the Athala yet - that can wait until after the trip.</p>
<p>Here is our schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1 - fly to Quito, Ecuador via Houston.  Not a significant time zone change but the trip will take most of the day.  We will stay at the <a href="http://www.swissotel.com/quito">Swissotel</a> for both stops in Quito.</li>
<li>Day 2 - explore Quito, primarily via some excellent <a href="http://www.quito.com.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=285&amp;Itemid=478&amp;lang=en">self-guided tours</a> we found at the tourism office.</li>
<li>Day 3 - fly to Baltra, Galapagos via Guyaquil.  Board the Athala for an eight day cruise around the islands.</li>
<li>Day 9 - fly back to Quito with just a half day to finish some local touring.</li>
<li>Day 10 - return to Portland via Houston</li>
</ul>

<p>I've got the photog gear packed, movies loaded on iPad, books on the Kindle.  See you on the other side.</p>
