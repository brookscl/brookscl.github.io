<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/rands-information-practices/">Rands Information Practices</a> – Great tips on managing your information diet as well as stealing precious seconds (that add up to minutes then hours) in your daily workflows.</li>
<li><a href="https://ournextlife.com/2018/06/20/roth-regrets/">Our Roth Regrets // The Roth IRA Strategy We Wish We’d Built</a> – I still follow the financial independence / early retirement (FIRE) community closely. Some good tips here for those of you in the earlier stages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-cheap-beer-is-still-awesome-and-5-you-should-enjoy-this-summer/">Why Cheap Beer Is Still Awesome (And 5 You Should Enjoy This Summer)</a> – Put me down for PBR. Important omission: Yuengling.</li>
<li><a href="https://hollandspiele.com/blogs/hollandazed-thoughts-ideas-and-miscellany/prepared-remarks">Tom Russell on Hollandspiele plans</a> – I’m starting to really like this company and their creativity (and their prolific publishing schedule). Confession: I haven’t played any of their games yet, so all I know is from reading reviews.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets">“I Was Devastated”: Tim Berners-Lee, the Man Who Created the World Wide Web, Has Some Regrets</a> – I understand his points but I’m not sure a new software package or platform is going to solve the problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimcoding">What I’m Coding</h2>
<ul>
<li>I continue to enhance our <a href="http://www.keuka.me">Keuka Komplishments</a> app. Fun to have a sandbox like this that people are actually using.</li>
<li>I’m building a lightweight Reddit clone for my upcoming <a href="http://www.wou.edu/wp/brooksc/">Microservice Architecture</a> class at Western Oregon. I’m building a monolithic app as a starting point for the class from which we will go through a series of refactorings into microservice architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2018/06/23/python-multiline-idioms/">Python Idioms: Multiline Strings</a> – I’m dialed in deeply to the Python community (podcasts, blogs, etc.) in the hopes of dramatically improving my inherent understanding and memory of the language and APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/14/618877786/first-listen-lera-lynn-plays-well-with-others">First Listen: Lera Lynn, ‘Plays Well With Others’</a> – This is a collection of collaborations. Easy listening country, and not the pop kind.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/14/618363676/first-listen-dawes-passwords">Even On ‘Passwords,’ Dawes Can’t Hide Its Big, Bleeding Heart</a> – I’m enjoying this one a lot.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<p>With guests that are gamers hanging around the last two weeks, a <em>lot</em> was played. Rather than bullet list each, here’s the scoop: Dominion, Fort Sumter, Wits &amp; Wagers, A Handful of Stars, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, 18NEB, Dixit, Jump Drive, Codenames, Jaipur, Ninety-Nine, Villages of Valeria, and Rummikub.</p>
<p>Speaking of Fort Sumter, there’s a <a href="https://theplayersaid.com/2018/06/28/fort-sumter-the-secession-crisis-1860-61-from-gmt-games-action-point-1/">nice overview of the game at The Player’s Aid</a>.</p>
