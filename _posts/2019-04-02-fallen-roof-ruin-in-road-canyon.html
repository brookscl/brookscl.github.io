<p>After exploring the Citadel ruin at the <em>top</em> of Road Canyon, we ventured down into the canyon then up the south face to visit Fallen Roof ruin. The name should be obvious from the photo above: the recess cave roof is collapsing, not the dwelling itself. Not an archaeologist but it is apparent that the roof was falling while still occupied.</p>

<p>The pictographs above are good evidence for why you should linger and observe while visiting these ruins. Neither of us noticed them until we were about to leave.</p>
<p>What inspired these images? Is it mere graffiti or was it done as a reward? Capture of family history?</p>
