excerpt: I’ve long been a fan of Martin Fowler.  Even sat down for lunch with him
  back in 2000 when we were both speakers at Software Development Expo in San Fran. 
  Now I learn that he’s into board games.  What’s next, a book on Refactoring Puerto
  Rico?  Or perhaps Strategy Game Analysis Patterns?
