excerpt: 'I''ve made some great progress, but have a tough 2 weeks ahead of my to
  complete my unplayed games list burndown.  While a few of the remaining games are
  quickies that I''ll easily knock out over the New Years weekend, there are also
  a few longish games that will be a bigger challenge.  Here''s the list:  Shogun
  Paths of Glory TurfMaster History of the World Starship Catan Britannia Corsairs
  and Hellcats Kingdoms El Caballero Bigkini Thief of Bagdad Master Labyrinth Hellas
  Hero Clix Cannes - Stars, Scripts and Screens Target Crazy Diamond & Karatino Malefiz
  Socks in the City Wooden Shoes & Iron Monsters New York Central 1850 Kunst and Kennis
  Spel 1850 should get played on the 27th at an after-work 18xx game night.  I''m
  most worried about Paths of Glory, History of the World, and Britannia.  I''ll keep
  you posted.'
