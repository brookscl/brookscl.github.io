excerpt: 'Has anyone else noticed the massive ad campaign in progress for Magic: the
  Gathering?  I’ve seen adverts in computer gaming magazines, the dropped a CD for
  Magic: Online in PC Gamer this month, I’m flipping channels here in the hotel and
  see a TV commercial for Ravnica, the release due later this month.  Maybe it isn’t
  a “massive” campaign, but I suspect it is a healthy launch.'
