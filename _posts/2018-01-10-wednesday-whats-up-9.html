<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html">Mark Zuckerberg, let Facebook rejoin the open web</a> – Continuing the dialog on Facebook openness, Dave Winer points out only one of the reasons I’m mostly off Facebook. I go on from time to time to check in on a few groups I belong to because there’s no other venue (West Point Dads, a game convention group).</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/936615043126370306">Patrick McKenzie on Twitter</a> – Oooh, I loved this Tweetstorm. “The hardest problem in B2C is distribution. The hardest problem in B2B is sales.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">Kernel-memory-leaking Intel processor design flaw forces Linux, Windows redesign</a> – This is the best technical description I’ve seen so far that I can understand. I’m following this closely because the design flaws are related to material I teach in the computer organization and architecture class I teach at WOU.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/10/17/richard-feynman-arline-letter/">Love After Life: Nobel-Winning Physicist Richard Feynman’s Extraordinary Letter to His Departed Wife</a> – This is true love.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimwatching">What I’m Watching</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/demanders/the-best-tv-shows-of-2017">The Best TV Shows of 2017</a> – One critic’s opinion, but some good validation here on shows I liked last year (Halt and Catch Fire, The Leftovers, Stranger Things) plus some good pointers to shows I must watch in 2018.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.avclub.com/in-its-glowing-two-part-finale-everyone-on-halt-and-ca-1819472740">In its glowing two-part finale, everyone on Halt And Catch Fire gets to the thing</a> – Julie and I loved this show and it just wrapped up and is fully available on Netflix. “The Computer is not the Thing!”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimpreparingtoplay">What I’m Preparing to Play</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wargamehq.com/flying-colors-long-overdue-review/">Flying Colors</a> – I have about seven unplayed wargames in my collection that I’m going to attempt to play within the next 12 weeks, and <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133518/blue-cross-white-ensign">Blue Cross, White Ensign</a> is one of them. This review covers the overall system, and my game is a self contained expansion that was on sale at GMT.</li>
<li>The other games I’m hoping to play:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/207572/holland-44-operation-market-garden">Holland ’44</a> (playing at <a href="http://gameon-con.com">Game On!</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/213648/south-pacific-breaking-bismarck-barrier-1942-1943">South Pacific</a> (playing on Monday with Chuck)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/190232/plan-orange-pacific-war-1930-1935">Plan Orange</a> (perhaps after Game On!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34747/jena-20">Jena 20</a> (maybe I’ll get Julie to play with me!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16162/target-arnhem-across-6-bridges">Target Arnhem</a> (another light magazine game)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187431/poland-strikes">Poland Strikes!</a> (from Yaah! magazine, not sure I’ll even try this)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11695/defiant-russia">Defiant Russia</a> (I have this setup right now to play solo and expect to play tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26944687">Julie and I played Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</a> and are in September. Big reveal this month and we are excited to play through the final four months.</li>
<li>We picked up <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/26958905">Jaipur</a> last night for the first time in quite a while and I got smoked 2–0 by Julie.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I finished <a href="http://amzn.to/2CPgXFC">River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life</a> and can’t say I loved it. The first half was enjoyable and pulled me in, but the second half seemed scattered and the book overall was lacking in conclusion and wrap-up.</li>
</ul>
