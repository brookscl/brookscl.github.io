excerpt: "  We spent most of our time play-testing a new game, but we managed to squeeze
  in a playing of the new Fantasy Flight game Quicksand.  This is a racing game where
  you advance one of six adventurers on your turn by playing cards of that adventurer's
  color. The catch is each player is trying to advance their secret adventurer while
  trying to guess which adventurers belong to which opponents.  Adventurers can be
  delayed by moving them into tight situations (like quicksand) or by playing quicksand
  cards.  This is a simple, quick game that won't be for everybody.  It has a fair
  bit of bluffing and misdirection, but there isn't enough time to do much but advance
  your adventurer and slow down whoever is in the lead.  There's a substantial luck
  element as well - I only drew 3 cards of my adventurer's color the whole game. 
  Mimi pulled this one out with Doug and Ken a close second.  This one will be fun
  with the kids, but a bit too light for my taste.  I'll give it a 6. "
