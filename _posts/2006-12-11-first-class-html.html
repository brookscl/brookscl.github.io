excerpt: I'm a United 1K class member (meaning I earn at least 100,000 qualifying
  miles in a year - two trips to Israel, a trip to Brussels, and a trip to Germany
  virtually guarantee this) so often get upgraded to 1st class when I do my frequent
  travel-to-the-east-coast-for-a-two-hour-meeting trips.   I often use this time to
  catch up on emails (though this is not nearly as critical now that I'm a GTD cult
  member - now, I use the time to knock off @offline next actions), reading, and weblog
  posts. You would think laptop power would be available in first class.  I'm well
  equiped with a universal power adapter including car and airplane DC power conversion,
  but alas no joy even in first class.  What I do notice is what used to be a power
  receptacle now covered with a screwed-on plate.  Come on - many American Airlines
  planes have power even in coach.  Portland is a long ways from everywhere so unless
  I carry 1 or 2 spare batteries with me I'm stuck.
