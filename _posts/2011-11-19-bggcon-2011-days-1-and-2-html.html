<p>Here's a quick rundown of what I've played so far:</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/48726/alien-frontiers">Alien Frontiers</a> -- One of my hope-to-play games from 2010. Reminds me of Mission: Red Planet but with a better mechanic (dice!) for placement and actions.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation">Innovation</a> -- Surprise hit so far, and at only $20 for the base game (and $20 for expansion) was an easy buy from the guys at Funagain.  Civilization-building card game with very creative mechanics and relatively short playing time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/69789/ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer">Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer</a> -- I've played about 100 times on the iPad and once before in real life.  Taught Jim how to play; solid deckbuilding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105624/poseidons-kingdom">Poseidon's Kingdom</a> -- The latest game from <a href="http://www.fragorgames.com/">Fragor Games</a>.  Took a while for us to get going without a real teacher but very fluid once we got down the core mechanics.  The "wave breaking" mechanism with dice raining down on the board is very slick.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/73439/troyes">Troyes</a> -- Another dice-based game but hardly overly random or chaotic.  This is a deep game that the four players fumbled through and generally enjoyed. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59294/runewars">Runewars</a> -- Big hit; we played with 3 players in a learning game and finished in about 2-3 hours.  Multi-player American style war and building game with a nice fantasy adventure twist set in the Runebound (and Descent) universe.  Would be a big hit with Jacob and Matthew.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19764/punct">PÃœNCT</a> -- Jim and I had 45 minutes before dinner and listening to the Sherwood football playoff game stream so played this game in the GIPF series.  Forgot how much I love these games.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108044/nefarious">Nefarious</a> -- Very light card game that Jim and I played with old friend Tim.  Fun enough for what it is, but I don't think it will be worth the $60 retail.  Feels like a $25 light card game to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow we expect to play <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/79828/a-few-acres-of-snow">A Few Acres of Snow</a>,  <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2612/18al">18AL</a>, and <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a>.</p>
