<p>Welcome to spring 2019! In this update I&#8217;m going to skip my gaming activity and put that into a separate post. In two days Julie and I take off on our annual April adventure, returning to the southwest USA for camping, hiking, and backpacking. So over the next month you&#8217;ll see a lot of single photos with short narratives posted here (using the handy <a href="https://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> app on my iPhone).</p>
<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I&#8217;m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober">My Restaurant Was the Greatest Show of Excess You’d Ever Seen, and It Almost Killed Me</a> &#8211; Great story about a man who had a necessary wake-up call that led to him realizing that you can socialize and have fun without alcohol and inebriation. I&#8217;m still working on this.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25980368">How former ref Tim Donaghy conspired to fix NBA games</a> &#8211; So the NBA still contends that a single referee can&#8217;t change the outcome of a game without anyone noticing, huh?</li>
<li><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/03/evidence-for-the-continental-axis-hypothesis.html">Evidence for the Continental Axis Hypothesis</a> &#8211; I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y9SSnX">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a> recently and understand that not everyone agrees with with Diamond&#8217;s assertions about how technology traveled more easily along latitudinal axis (vs. longitudinal).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gya8bx/i-tested-the-saving-technique-that-promises-retirement-at-40">I Tested the Saving Technique That Promises Retirement at 40</a> &#8211; What a hatchet job of a story. Even the sub headline: &#8220;The FIRE—&#8217;financial independence, retire early&#8217;—movement is all about hoarding enough cash before investing it and living off the dividends.&#8221; is laughably silly: he simply described what retirement is about, not early retirement. And you don&#8217;t hoard all the cash, then invest it. You simply spend significantly less than you earn while continuously investing the surplus. His situation, &#8220;28 with no mortgage, nowhere near enough savings for a deposit, and student debt larger than the money I make in a year&#8221; puts him squarely <em>outside</em> the target audience for FIRE. Instead he should focus on <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps">Dave Ramsey&#8217;s baby steps</a> and deal with his debt and lifestyle issues before contemplating FIRE.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimwatching">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/demanders/the-best-current-source-for-streaming-classic-movies-is--amazon-prime">The Best Current Source for Streaming Classic Movies is &#8230; Amazon Prime?</a> &#8211; There&#8217;s some good stuff right now on Amazon! What I watched over the past month included:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050825/">Paths of Glory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/">The Great Escape</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074119/">All the President&#8217;s Men</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/">Chinatown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040724/">Red River</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7459986/">The Widow</a> &#8211; better than average escapist thriller stuff, with some rather large plot holes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I&#8217;m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I listened to Halberstam&#8217;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2HwCcC9">The Best and the Brightest</a> and it was a great conclusion to my deep dive into the Kennedy / Johnson years and the tragedy of Vietnam.</li>
<li>Julie and I both finished the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ye95bH">Broken Earth Trilogy</a> and think it is some of the best sci-fi fantasy we&#8217;ve read in the past few years. And it actually had a good conclusion to the trilogy.</li>
<li>I read and loved <a href="https://amzn.to/2TnzSyS">Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress</a> but understand there are some strong critics out there. I put this book squarely with <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fjjzhn">Factfulness</a>: simply a take on the state of society across several dimensions, with some forecasting about what the future might hold. He doesn&#8217;t preclude some bad shit happening again. He doesn&#8217;t assert that we can rest on our laurels as society will simply monotonically improve on its own. Why the hate?
<ul>
<li>You might enjoy reading about <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2019/03/13/why-is-pinker-demonized/">Why is Pinker demonized?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As another prep read for our SW adventure, I read through most of <a href="https://amzn.to/2WgjdiA">The Man Who Walked Through Time: The Story of the First Trip Afoot Through the Grand Canyon</a>. I enjoyed the opening bits about his preparation and initial descent into the canyon much more than the rest of the travel log.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I&#8217;m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/681763972/first-listen-lula-wiles-what-will-we-do">Lula Wiles, &#8216;What Will We Do&#8217;</a> &#8211; Like Dixie Chicks? You&#8217;ll probably enjoy this too.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/24/687481767/first-listen-mandolin-orange-tides-of-a-teardrop">First Listen: Mandolin Orange, &#8216;Tides Of A Teardrop&#8217;</a> &#8211; Good folky stuff.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691387517/first-listen-hayes-carll-what-it-is">First Listen: Hayes Carll, &#8216;What It Is&#8217;</a> &#8211; I like Hayes Carll but I&#8217;m not sure he&#8217;s a great songwriter. The hooks aren&#8217;t always there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlearning">What I&#8217;m Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>I travel with a much smaller photography kit these days, namely my iPhone 7+ and Julie&#8217;s new iPhone Xr. I want to get better landscapes on this coming trip, plus experiment more with long exposure. The built in tools for this are very nifty in iOS, but I plan to try out the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/spectre-a-computational-approach-to-long-exposure-iphone-photography/">Spectre app</a> to see if I can up my game even further.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m still baking more bread.</li>
</ul>
