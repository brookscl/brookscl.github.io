excerpt: 'I hosted what has become an annual gaming event at our Salishan home earlier
  this month (read about 2005, early 2007, and late 2007) earlier this month. Doug
  (part 1, part 2, part 3, and part 4) and Mike (report 1, report 2, wrap-up) already
  did excellent writeups on the details - read below for photos and some color commentary.
  The weather was spectacular with the usual variety of quiet sunny day to raging
  rainstorms. Doug, JD, and I took some time out to walk on the beach and get some
  nice sunset photos.  The weekend kicked off with a game of After the Flood where
  I taught and schooled Doug and Mike. One of my favorites from 2008 but I suspect
  it will be difficult to get this out more than 1-2 times per year given the nature
  of the game.  Ironically enough (you know why I say ironically if you know the story
  behind Martin Wallace and John Bohrer''s falling out) we played Age of Scheme (read
  Lorna''s commentary about our play). Decent game that feels a bit like Wabash Cannonball
  but has enough distinct about it to make it interesting. Don''t think I need to
  add it to my collection though, especially if I get my hands on a copy of Chicago
  Express.  Ken, Ben, and Doug played a very long game of Starcraft: the Boardgame.
  I need to get this on the table again - Jacob even asked for this last night.  One
  of the longer games scheduled for the weekend was FAB:Bulge with Mike and Eric.
  Turned out to not take as long as expected - I think this gave them time to play
  Le Havre (pictured below).  I taught Lorna, Ben, and Matt how to play After the
  Flood on Friday (the report on Age of Scheme above by Lorna also includes comments
  on this game).  While After the Flood happened, I played Le Havre with Ken and KC.
  We played the short game but messed up the start, not giving us any of the required
  starting materials. Talk about a slow, incredibly constrained game! We were barely
  able to keep up with food production, let along build out our cities.  One of the
  highlights for everyone was playing Battlestar Galactica. This is a game I can''t
  wait to introduce to my family (Julie is a big BSG fan) - tense cooperative gameplay
  at its best. Could this surpass Lord of the Rings as our favorite co-op game? We''ll
  see...  Ken Crangle made it for Saturday only but maximized his gaming experience,
  walking through several of the Conflict of Heroes scenarios with Doug and joining
  me for a great game of Battlestar Galactica on Saturday evening.  Things wound down
  on Sunday and Ben took the opportunity to teach his new prototype to KC and Rita.
  Looked big and fun - wish I knew more about it.  I spent the morning doing laundry,
  cleaning, and playing Indonesia! Despite messing up a critical rule (we somehow
  forgot that adjacent crops to cities still need to be transported via ship) we had
  a blast. I''m convinced this is a game that can and should be played on standard
  Tuesday night gaming session.  That''s it - heavy on photos, light on the writing
  but Doug and Mike covered the details better than I could have. Thanks to all of
  my wonderful guests and I look forward to a repeat in 2009.'
