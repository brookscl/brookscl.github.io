excerpt: 'I posted a note to spielfrieks several weeks ago about a liquidation sale
  at my local Wizards of the Coast store, particularly the discount on Tigris & Euphrates
  ($25).  Mikael Sheikh pinged back asking if I would pick up a couple of copies to
  ship to New York City for him and his friend Jonathan.  I gladly obliged and told
  him I''d give him a heads up if I was going to be in NYC so we could get together
  for some gaming.  On my way to Keuka Lake in western NY, I needed to spend some
  time visiting a potential partner in Manhattan.  Never one to miss out on a potential
  game night, I let Mikael know I would be in town. He and Jonathan were kind enough
  to reschedule their weekly game night in Brooklyn from Tuesday to Monday, and Mikael
  offered to meet me after work for dinner in lower Manhattan.  We thought we''d have
  some time to play a two-player game, but we got very wrapped up in conversation
  over some great Thai food and before we knew it we needed to head to the F train
  to cruise over to Brooklyn.  Mikael happens to work in technology planning for the
  transit authority so is an expert on how the subways are controlled and operated. 
  He also loves games with a public transportation theme.  Jonathan was waiting for
  us and we got started at 8:45pm.  He expected one more to arrive around 10pm, so
  we quickly settled into a 3 player game of Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico  This was about
  my 6th play of Puerto Rico, and I need to move beyond the discovery stage and learn
  how to play this game well.  I''m certainly getting the hang of the flow and I do
  find it easier to make most decisions, but I''m certainly without a clear strategy
  when I play.  Time to read up on strategy again on spielfrieks and work on improving
  my game.  Strangely enough the last two games I''ve played have ended up in a dead
  heat - this time Jonathan and Mikael each tied with 51 points, 2 gold, zero barrels. 
  Still a 9 in my book.  Wallenstein  I requested ahead of time that we play this
  game.  I''ve been in the mood for richer games lately - probably a bit of nostalgia
  for my early days playing the big Avalon Hill war games.  Jonathan''s neighbor Lev
  joined us and we proceeded to start a 4 player game of this war game set in Germany
  / Austro-Hungary in the 30 years war.  The simple comparison for this game is to
  say that it is Risk-like.  Colored cubes represent forces in provinces, and the
  basic goal is to expand to as many provinces as possible while accumulating economic
  strength by building palaces, churches, and trading houses.  We used the basic canned
  setup and I was yellow, meaning the bulk of my forces started the game in the south-central
  portion of the board.  There are some very interesting mechanics in this game that
  I''ll discuss individually:   The Turn Sequence involves the play of 4 seasons in
  two consecutive years.  Actions are taken in spring, summer, and fall, while winter
  is where the wheat harvest is consumed, peasants go hungry and (possibly) revolt,
  and points are scored.  So there are two scoring rounds in the game.  Very similar
  to Amun Re.  Player Actions are programmed ahead of time.  In each season a random
  sequence of the same 10 actions will occur, including wheat production, gold production,
  force deployment, force transfer, combat, and building construction.  At the start
  of a season, the first 5 actions that will occur are revealed - the remaining 5
  are revealed sequentially as play progresses so that there are always 5 actions
  in the queue (until the last 5 are reached of course).  Actions are programmed by
  players by linking them to specific provinces controlled by that player.  For example,
  if I plan to initiate combat from Bremen, I would lay the Bremen province card face-down
  on one of the two combat actions. There are also blank action cards that can be
  laid down if the player has no plans to take that action.  In some cases, an action
  might be nullified (e.g., if the player loses a province to another player or peasants
  before it shows up, or if the player doesn''t have enough gold to perform the action). 
  Otherwise, when a province/action comes up the player must take that action.  Random
  Global Events occur in each season that change the global context for the game. 
  At the start of each year, players know what 4 events might happen, but not in what
  order.  Only the first three events will be used, since the fourth card will be
  used to determine how harsh the winter is and how much wheat will be required to
  satisfy the peasants.  If a player under produces wheat that year, he may feel the
  brunt of a massive peasant revolt and lose one or more provinces.  Player Turn Order
  is determined randomly each season.  Like most games, sometimes it is great to be
  first, sometimes it is best to be last.  Victory Point Scoring is calculated using
  a number of factors.  Players score points for the number of provinces and buildings
  under their control at the end of the year and by having the majority of a particular
  building type in a region.  Combat Resolution is clearly the coolest part about
  this game.  Rather than rolling hordes of dice, an amazing sieve-like contraption
  is used to randomly filter and pass through player force cubes.  Since some pieces
  get trapped in the device, they can come back later to help in successive combat
  rounds.  So if you get screwed in a particular combat (e.g., I once went into a
  combat with a 7 to 3 advantage but still lost), there''s hope that it will balance
  out later in the game as your pieces are dislodged from the bowels of the tower. 
  I like this system so much more than dice rolling - resolution happens immediately
  and it balances out combat in the long run.  You may have guessed that I love this
  game, even though I finished last.  Mikael pulled out a strong victory, followed
  by Jonathan, Lev, and me.  I''ll rate this an 8 after my first play.  I''ll post
  some pictures of this session once I''m back to a broadband connection.  Right now
  I''m dealing with slow dialup from western NY. '
