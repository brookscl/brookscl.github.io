excerpt: Shannon Appelcline wrote a nice review of the Iron Dragon Computer Game over
  at RPG.Net.  Funny thing, I just discovered this game on Saturday after a referral
  from Doug Walker.  I've played the demo and was quite impressed.  I purchased the
  game at a fire sale at Amazon ($15 or $20) but still haven't played the “real-life”
  version.  I'm going to try the trial a few more times but it looks like a likely
  purchase.
