excerpt: 'There’s been just a little bit of gaming around our household over the last
  few weeks.  High time for a post with a few photos. About a week ago I returned
  from a business trip in Memphis and joined Jacob, Nick, and Julie in a game of Ticket
  to Ride: Europe on a late Friday afternoon.  Nick was new to Ticket to Ride but
  picked up the rules easily.  Maybe there is some correlation with having two football
  players play the game, but this was the most confrontational game of TtR I’ve ever
  played.  This was mostly due to Nick focusing on very small routes and doing whatever
  he could to disrupt our progress (mostly Julie, but he got after Jacob and me as
  well).  While it wasn’t very successful, it did make for an entertaining and tension-packed
  game (mostly positive energy) as Nick tried to figure out who to mess up next. 
  I think he learned that this isn’t really a viable strategy but he sure did have
  some fun along the way. The next day KC and Rita joined us at our home for an overnight
  and some final planning for the launch of HAVOC: the Hundred Years War.  We did
  manage to squeeze in a bit gaming though, including a couple of our new games from
  SimplyFun.  Saturday night we played Walk the Dogs, my first play of it with the
  family.  The kids really liked the game, though I somehow managed to pull off a
  surprise win by collecting five consecutive puppies.  This is a pretty chaotic game
  but  enjoyable nonetheless.   We also gave the junior version of Eye to Eye a try,
  and this was an even bigger hit.  As easy to play as Apples to Apples, I think this
  game is a bit more fun.  I you are a fan of Scattergories give this one a try. 
  It does seem to be a bit overpriced for what you get, but maybe I’ll find some other
  use for all those little wooden cubes. On Sunday morning we played a 5–player game
  of Parthenon: Rise of the Aegean.  We again were able to play in just over two hours
  and response was overwhelmingly positive.  We did run into a kingmaker decision
  on the last turn, where Jacob was the Archon and could choose another player to
  damage pretty seriously (no commodity production that turn).  He chose to hurt KC,
  possibly because KC had been a bit more vocal in stating his ability to win that
  turn (I was in the same position).  This allowed me to win the game, but it was
  a hollow victory.   I coached Jacob a bit after the game, suggesting that it might
  have been better to hurt Matthew or Rita, who were unlikely to win that turn.  This
  is a tough call and raises some concerns about the game, but maybe this was an unusual
  occurrence.  In any case, we had fun and I look forward to playing again soon.'
