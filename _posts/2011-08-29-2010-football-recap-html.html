<p>Judging from the traffic this blog still gets I think I owe my audience much more frequent updates than I’ve been providing (here I am talking about blogging again and not football). I’ll try to do better.</p>
<p>I owe you a recap of how the 2010 season finished. Short summary: we won the championship for our division, one of four 8th grade varsity teams <a href="http://tvyfl.org/scores/2010_championships/">to win championships in the Tualatin Valley Youth Football league (TVYFL)</a>. Interestingly, <em>both</em> Sherwood teams won championships, showing just how deep that 8th grade (now incoming freshman) class was.</p>
<p>TVYFL did a nice highlight film of our championship game (see embed below). The game against Tigard started off very slow (remember, we <a href="/2010/09/week-2-and-3-updates.html">lost to them earlier in the season</a>) with them driving easily to the endzone with their strong running game in the first quarter. Our kids stepped up with some hard-nosed football on both sides of the ball and eventually ran away with it 42–14.</p>

<p>Honestly I felt the game was closer than the score indicated, and Tigard losing their star receiver at halftime (who beat us in the first game) didn’t help them at all.</p>
<p>I also made a highlight reel of our full season:</p>

<p>That championship game was likely the last time I’ll ever coach my own son in football. I can’t stay away from the game though and signed up for another year of coaching the eight graders. More on that soon.</p>
