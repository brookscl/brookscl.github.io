excerpt: Cool – twice in two weeks I’m able to hook up with a local gaming group while
  away on business.  Last Thursday I joined David Fair and a group of his gaming friends
  at the Game Parlor in Chantilly, VA, a short 10 minute drive from my hotel near
  Dulles airport. The Game Parlor is an outstanding game store, both in terms of selection
  and gaming facilities.  There were easily over 15 tables available for gaming –
  there was a CCG tournament going on, folks playing miniatures, a game of Ticket
  to Ride, two wargames, and we didn’t feel squeezed at all. David did his homework
  and new I was a fan of For Sale, so he offered that up as an opener.  As straightforward
  as the game rules appear to be, I quickly learned that this group plays the game
  much differently than I have.  You can check out these two threads on BGG for an
  example of the confusion.  I’ve always played that you lose have your bid in value
  to the bank when you don’t win the auction.  These guys play that you lose half
  your chips to the bank, making the use of the $2 chips meaningful in more ways than
  just the increase bidding.  I’d like to blame confusion over this rule on my poor
  play (I finished dead last), but alas I just played poorly in the first round of
  auctions, making it very difficult to have any kind of strong showing in the blind
  bidding phase. David recommended San Francisco for our next play – apparently this
  is a solid game for five players.  To learn more about the mechanics of the game,
  check out this review by Brian Bankler. While I greatly enjoyed the other players
  and some aspects of the game, a few of the mechanics left me cold.  The human factors
  in the game are also a big challenge (this was also called out in Brian’s review),
  causing mistakes by several of the players at different times during the game. My
  primary complaints were about the bidding mechanics.  On some of the auctions, you
  are trying to choose a type of building type that the others won’t choose (residential,
  recreational, or business).  While there’s some information on the board to help
  guide a player’s choice, this felt very much like Hoity Toity to me – and most of
  you know my feelings on Hoity Toity.  The other mechanic that was annoying as hell
  was the influence auctions.  Players each choose an influence card ranging from
  0 to 9 points.  The auction might give the prize to the top 2 bidders that don’t
  tie.  So if three players each bid 9, one bid 1, and the other 0, the players who
  bid 1 and 0 would win the auction.  This leads to similar attempts to out-think
  your opponents and left me cold.  I think I finished in last again on this one,
  but the game was a bit closer and given one more turn I might have moved up to third
  or fourth place. We wrapped up our evening with a game of Formula Motor Racing after
  adding a 6th player.  I had seen this played over at Doug & Mimi’s but had not played
  it before.  This is a great little game and a solid choice for six players – one
  I might consider adding to my collection.  Adding to the appeal was the nice little
  track accompanying this game (don’t expect to find this in the box – this was fan
  made and I don’t even see a file on the geek for it).  We spent some time chatting
  after gaming about travel, Essen, and the Gathering.  I also picked up a copy of
  Roma from the store – I felt obligated to pick something up after taking advantage
  of such a fine gaming facility.  A good purchase as I’ll illustrate soon.  Thanks
  to David & co. for your hospitality and company.  I’ll check in again next time
  I’m in the area.
