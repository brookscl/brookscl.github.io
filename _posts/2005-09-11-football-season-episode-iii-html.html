excerpt: 'This is our third year as football parents, and now we have the joy (and
  often inconvenience) of having both Jacob and Matthew playing.  Of course they are
  on different teams, at different levels, which almost ensures that each week each
  of us gets to see only one of them play. The Sherwood teams had a clean sweep this
  weekend, with the high school team winning 38–0 Friday night and all of the youth
  football teams from grades 3–9 winning their games as well (that’s about 12 teams
  in all). Jacob is again playing primarily center on offense, also getting some time
  at tackle as he covers for an injured player.  On defense Jacob also plays defensive
  tackle.  He’s a solid lineman and the competition is getting fierce at this level
  – below you can see him squaring off against a nose tackle weighing in at over 200
  lbs (Jacob is about 120 lbs in his gear).   Matthew (number 28 below) in his first
  year is playing fullback on offense and cornerback on defense.  As a third grader
  he’s doing a great job surrounded by mostly fourth graders handling the ball.   Matthew
  had three carries in his game on Friday, with one breakaway for 20 yards where he
  almost score a touchdown but was caught by a lone tackler at about the 20 yard line. '
