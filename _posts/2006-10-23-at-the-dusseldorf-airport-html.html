excerpt: Bags checked in fine - no weight issues but all three bags I checked were
  about 24 kilos each. I guess I fit within the 1-2 kilo grace range. We had some
  good trades at the end of the day for some of our remaining stock. Picked up Frey's
  Folly, the Ned Kelley game, Big Kini,  Crazy Diamond and Caraten (I might have the
  name wrong) and Guru.
