excerpt: I had the pleasure of attending the  GameStorm convention in Portland, OR
  last weekend.  I had business  travel on Friday and a Cub Scout Pinewood Derby to
  run most of Saturday, but  managed to spend time at the con Saturday evening and
  most of Sunday.  I  went by myself Saturday, but brought the whole family on Sunday. 
  KC  Humphrey ran an excellent "Intro to Euros" session on Sunday that I thought  would
  be perfect for my wife Julie, son Jacob (age 8), and Matthew (age 6).   I had originally
  planned to just take Jacob, but Matthew became pretty  distraught at being excluded
  and I decided to take a chance and bring him.   He has played Carcassonne, Settlers,
  and a few other similar games. Saturday Evening - Solo Settlers  of Catan - Cities
  and Knights I have played Settlers of Catan as well as the 2 player card game, but
  never  this expansion.  It took a while to understand the mechanics, and I found  myself
  trailing most of the game (we played 5 players on the 4 player board).   I really
  enjoyed the added complexity of this expansion - there are more choices  to make
  and more tension created by the raids.  I enjoyed this so much I  bought the expansion
  from a retailer at the convention.  I ended up  finishing in the middle of the pack
  with 8 victory points but only got that  close when an opponent interrupted one
  of the two leaders' longest road with a  knight, giving me the new longest road.  Carcassonne
  I managed to get in two casual games of Carcassonne in the open playing area.  I
  played against two opponents that were just learning, and there was some  initial
  confusion on the scoring, particularly for the farmers.  I won the  first game and
  finished second in the second game. Sunday - with the Family Our morning was spent
  with KC Humphrey and Jay Schindler who were running the  Intro to Euros track, designed
  primarily to introduce families to German-style  games.  We hit it off - KC and
  Jay were just fabulous with the kids; they  made the day worthwhile.  Liar's Dice
  Believe it or not, I had never played this game, and it was the biggest hit  of
  the day with the kids.  Probably because it was the first time they were  able to
  repeatedly call their mother a liar!  This is a keeper and I'll be  looking for
  this at a thrift store soon.  Matthew, Jacob, and Jay won with  5 dice (we stopped
  when the first player ran out of dice).  Viva Pamplona The theme was a blast - running
  with the bulls in Pamplona and accumlating  bravery points.  We raced along trying
  to stay close to the bull, and KC  ended up accumulating the most points. Wildlife  Adventure
  I loved the cards and theme for this game - traveling the world trying to  locate
  endagered species.  We played very cooperatively, and Julie was the  first to go
  out and accumulated the most animals. 6 Tage  Rennen I've heard that this game about
  bicycle racing is fairly rare (it was  published in 1988).  It was moderately enjoyable,
  but I don't see much  replay value.  This is a game where a random factor would
  actually help.   Coming from behind seems almost impossible.  Toni, a young girl
  that joined  us for a while, pulled ahead at the end for the victory. Aquarius After
  finishing the Intro to Euros session and having some lunch, we spent  about two
  hours at a Looney Labs demo.   I've played Fluxx  and several of the  Icehouse games,
  so was eager to try a few more Looney games.  We first  tried Aquarius, a card game
  similar to dominos.  Very light but enjoyable,  but given a choice between this
  and Fluxx I think we'd usually choose Fluxx.   Matthew won this one. Martian  Chess
  Jacob and I gave the Icehouse game of Martian Chess a try next - even though  we
  have several Icehouse stashes we had yet to try this one.  We both found  ourselves
  making bonehead moves - it is hard to get used to controlling the  pieces by location,
  not color.  I sneaked by and won 15-12.  Chrononauts Jacob and I sat down with two
  others to try this.  It looked a bit  daunting for Jacob given the historical context
  for the game, but we both loved  it.  Definitely a heavier game than Fluxx (in fact,
  the heaviest Looney  game that I've played).  Jacob sneaked up and won this one.
  Carabande I've always wanted to play this - our family has enjoyed carom boards
  (we  have one and several of our Indian friends do as well), so the combination
  of a  flicking game with racing was a sure hit for the boys.  They spent 90  minutes
  here and we had to drag them away.  Not sure I want to fork over  the $ for my own
  copy, but I'll give it serious consideration.
