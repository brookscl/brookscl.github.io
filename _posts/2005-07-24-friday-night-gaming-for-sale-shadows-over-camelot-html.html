excerpt: 'We had a family meeting Wednesday night and decided to do a game night Friday
  evening.  Jacob and I will be on the coast at Adventure Cove camping with the Cub
  Scouts while Matthew and Julie will spend the week at Camp Ireland at day camp –
  we needed some time together with just the four of us.  Consensus was to start with
  a light opener then tackle the new Days of Wonder release Shadows Over Camelot.
  I was eager to finally try the light auction game For Sale. I recently picked up
  the Uberplay reprint and was able to teach the game in less than 5 minutes; we played
  in about 20.         Jacob, Julie, and Matthew during our game of For Sale. This
  was a big hit!  Jacob pulled out the victory with Julie and I close behind tied
  for second.  Matthew wasn’t that far back and everyone enjoyed it.  I love games
  with a simple mechanic or two that can be played quickly.  For Sale is played in
  two phases: first is the buying of properties, second is the selling.  When buying
  properties, a number of cards are turned up equal to the number of players who then bid
  in clockwise fashion for the privilege of getting the best property.  When a player
  passes he gives half of his bid (rounded up) to the bank and takes the worst available
  property.  The player with the highest bid after all of the other players have passed
  pays the full amount of the bid and gets the best property.  This is repeated until all
  of the properties have been auctioned. Next comes the selling phase.  In addition
  to the property cards, there are an equal number of “checks” that correspond to
  the income from selling cards.  This phase starts with a random draw of a number
  of checks equal to the number of players – the checks are valued anywhere from 0
  to $15,000.  Each player secretly chooses a property to sell, then all players simultaneously
  reveal.  The best property revealed gets the best check, and so on.  Simple but
  elegent, this one should come out often. We then decided to learn and play the new
  cooperative game Shadows Over Camelot.  Coop games are generally a big hit in my
  family, and for many reasons I like Jacob and Matthew to play games where they work
  together rather than against each other.           Jacob and Matthew strategize
  in Shadows Over Camelot.  The production of this game is, as expected, first rate
  (read about the mechanics here).  Learning the game was not trivial – I’m glad I
  was able to observe part of a session at work first, as learning from the rulebook
  was a bit challenging for everyone.  We misplayed a few rules in our first game,
  and I suspect we are violating the spirit of the discussion/cooperation rules. 
  Who cares – we had a blast.           Julie, Jacob, and Matthew examining the board.
  We lost our first game to the siege engines but it was close.  Everyone wanted a
  re-match tonight (Saturday) so we gave it another try.  It played much faster this
  time and we won fairly easily.  In both games we played without the traitor – I
  wanted us to win as a group before introducing that element of the game.  Next time
  we’ll give it a try.'
