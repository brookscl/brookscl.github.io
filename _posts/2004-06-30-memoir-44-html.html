excerpt: I finally received my copy of Memoir '44 this week, the new game from Days
  of Wonder.  DoW is on a roll, with the Alan Moon designed game Ticket to Ride winning
  the Spiel des Jahres award announced this week. Jacob and I sat down for a quick
  game tonight before dinner (Matthew was preparing dinner for all of us to earn a
  Cub Scout achievement) to give this one a try. Having already played the great American
  civil war game Battle Cry, learning Memoir '44 was a snap.  I hadn't pre-read the
  rules and we were able to get started within 20 minutes.  10 minutes of prep time
  was setting things up for the first scenario, Pegasus Bridge.  This scenario is
  a great way to learn the basics of the game as it only includes infantry and a subset
  of the terrain features. Turns happen very quickly - there's essentially zero downtime. 
  Command cards greatly limit the choices each player has in a turn (these simulate
  the challenges of command/control in this tactical environment, though I wonder
  how well this translates in WWII-era gaming.  Civil war I can understand, but I
  think operations could be better coordinated than is depicted in this game.  Alas,
  this is a game, not a simulation...).  Luck plays a significant factor, both in
  the luck of the draw and in the dice rolling.  This appears to be a great family
  game for us and I highly recommend it for fans of A&A D-Day, Battle Cry, and other
  lighter tactical wargames. The components are first class, particularly the rule
  book.  Days of Wonder is doing a great job supporting the product as well, providing
  an excellent portal for folks to share scenarios, after action reports, and strategies.
