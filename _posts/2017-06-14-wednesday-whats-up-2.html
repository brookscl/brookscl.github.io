<p>First off, <a href="http://plan-pack-go.com/31-days-exploring-cambodia-and-vietnam/">Julie posted a summary of our trip to Cambodia and Vietnam</a>. There are quite a few placeholders in there, but she’s already published several articles on our 5 week trip.</p>
<h3 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thecontrol.co/cryptoeconomics-101-e5c883e9a8ff">Cryptoeconomics 101</a> – I’m trying to get smarter about this field. I have a decent understanding of the computer science behind it, but there are some crazy economic and monetary ramifications in this area.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Tried the beer <a href="http://www.hsbeer.com/brews/brew/VVN0LCgAANCifddJ">Loose Cannon</a> while we were in Maine. Gave it a rating of 4.5. My kinda IPA. Love the grapefruit notes and suspect it will go perfectly with my burger.</li>
<li>Tried the beer <a href="http://www.risingtidebrewing.com/printemps/">Entrepot printemps at Finback Alehouse</a> on June 08 2017. Gave it a rating of 4.5. I should always order Saison when I see a new one. Rich and tasty.</li>
<li>Tried the beer <a href="http://www.allagash.com/beer/st-klippenstein/">St. Klippenstein (2015)</a> at Novare Res Bier Cafe in Portland ME. Gave it a rating of 4.25. What a find! Bourbon bottle aged wonder</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/movies/the-25-best-films-of-the-21st-century.html">The 25 Best Films of the 21st Century So Far.</a> – I love lists like this. Great conversation and argument starter. There Will Be Blood? Sure, but what happened to No Country for Old Men? At least Inside Llewyn Davis made it - I love slow, talky dramas like that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimlearning">What I’m Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/06/facts-about-qatar.html">Facts about Qatar</a> – 1. Qatar is about the size of Yorkshire or Connecticut. 2. The United States and Qatar have been friendly only since the first Gulf War; before then, the relationship was somewhat hostile or at least problematic.</li>
</ul>
