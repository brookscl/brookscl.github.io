excerpt: 'The season wrapped up for both boys on Saturday with dramatic victory for
  one young man and a heartbreaking loss for the other. Jacob''s team faced their
  nemesis - a Westview team that handed them their only loss of the year earlier in
  the season. This team was so confident that some of the players on the other team
  were spotted wearing "10-0" t-shirts that some brilliant parent must have had printed
  before the championship game.  Jacob caught a TD pass late in the second half that
  put Sherwood up 16-7 and they never looked back, winning 48-20 in a dominant display
  of offense and defense that had their opponents completely demoralized by midway
  through the 3rd quarter. This is a great way for Jacob to finish up his youth football
  career - now it is on to high school ball!  Matthew''s team (that I help coach)
  wasn''t so fortunate. We also faced our nemesis - a Lincoln team that beat us 34-12
  in our first game of the season. In game with driving rain and high winds, it boiled
  down to a defensive showdown and was scoreless at the end of regulation. In the
  second overtime, the start Lincoln tailback broke free for a 13 yard touchdown run
  and the game (and season) were over. The team outplayed themselves and stood up
  to a team that thought they had an easy walk to the championship. Our defense held
  them to 61 total yards in the game (including the 2 overtimes) and held their heads
  high in defeat. '
