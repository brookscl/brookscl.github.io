excerpt: I am sitting in the Singapore Air lounge in Singapore right now, waiting
  for my flight to Beijing.  It is about midnight here, and we arrive around 7am. 
  Things went well in KL - we had a great customer conference and I was able to spend
  some valuable time with our integration partner based in KL.        Scott, Trevor,
  Chris, and John having dinner in Chinatown in KL. The days and nights were fairly
  busy after the first day, so the tourist activities were limited to one evening
  spent wandering around Chinatown looking for some good shopping deals and having
  dinner.        The staple beverage in KL. Depending on how much rest we get on the
  flight to Beijing, we may be able to go see the palace before our first business
  meeting at 2pm.        A not-so-great view of the crowded market in Chinatown in
  KL.
