excerpt: " After another long week of travel, I was determined to spend as many waking
  hours over the weekend with Julie, Jacob, and Matthew.  On Saturday, Julie and Jacob
  had a Cub Scout outing for the morning and early afternoon.  Matthew and I did some
  Christmas shopping, had lunch and Matthew's favorite fast food joint (Arby's), then
  came home for some fun one-on-one time.  We opened up the game closet to see what
  we should play - we both agreed that Battlecards would be a great two-player game
  to idle away the afternoon.  Battlecards: World Conflict, Pacific Theatre   I own
  each of the expansions for this game except for the newly released North African
  Campaign.  I wrote a review of the first product back in March.      This game was
  very one-sided, with me on top for the entire game.  In fact, we didn't even finish
  the game since it was clear I would prevail.  The Pacific expansion is different
  in that most of the battles have Pearl Harbor as a pre-requisite.  This potentially
  leads to quite a bit of buildup before the first battle.  Unfortunately for Matthew,
  I drew most of the military buildup cards.  This just shouldn't happen - there's
  a decent distribution of these cards, so I don't think this is a flaw in the game.
  \ Battlecards: World Conflict, The Russian Front   Jacob arrived and saw the tail
  end of my game with Matthew, so we went to battle on the eastern front.  Similar
  result this time - I ended up winning every battle and achieving the victory condition
  of > 1/2 available victory points.  Even though these games were one-sided, I still
  really enjoy playing this game.     Can't Stop   Julie, Matthew, and I played an
  abbreviated game of Can't Stop before bed time.  This has become one our light favorites
  - very often when I come home from work I learn that Julie has played this with
  the boys after coming home from school.  I won with an amazing string of high rolls
  on the 10 and 11 tracks.  "
