excerpt: Tim Schutz was kind enough to send me a free deck of his  Alpha Playing Cards for  review. 
  Tim has done some great work, and his focus on gaming systems  rather than just
  games is very appealing. An Alpha deck consists of 74 cards - 42 consonant cards,
  30 vowel cards (each  vowel card has two vowels printed on it), and 2 wild cards. 
  You can purchase  a deck from tjgames, or print  one out for yourself.  There is
  a similar mass-market game called Quiddler that  is similar, but I find the card
  distribution and extensibility better in  Alpha. I have played several different
  games with Alpha with adults and kids.   It has already become a staple filler game
  for our family.  My 2 sons (ages  6 and 8) enjoy some of the simpler games, and
  we've found interesting variations  of the games that allow us to handicap the adults
  to let the kids be more  competitive.  Let's discuss a few of the games. makeAwordThis
  is a great, open-ended game for kids where  the victory conditions can be tuned
  and tweaked to suit the  audience.    7-10 cards (more cards make the game easier)
  are  dealt to the middle of the playing area, and players alternate making the best  word
  possible from the inventory.  The cards are refreshed after each  player makes a
  word.  The winner can be determined by points, funniest  word, word with most consonants,
  etc.  This one is Matthew's (6)  favorite. 6x6A solitaire game in which you try
  and use up all of  the cards in a 6x6 grid.  This solitaire game is the better of
  the two - I  found there were more choices to make and strategic elements than in  WordSolitaire.
  Alpha WarThis is modeled on the game War played with  standard playing cards.  The
  deck is split in two, and players alternate  dropping cards in the center of the
  table.  Once three cards are on the  table, a player can either make a word or pass. 
  When a player makes a  word, she gets to keep the cards.  The goal is to capture
  all of the  cards.  Matthew enjoys this one as well. WordSnakeThis is an unusual
  game and one I expect to  play more.  There are no turns - play happens in real-time
  -  it reminds me of some of the Icehouse games.   Each player is dealt 13 cards,
  and a central pool of 9 cards is placed in the  center of the table.  The dealer
  calls "1,2,3, GO!" and players proceed to  try and build a word snake - words with
  at least 3 letters, where each  successive word begins with the last letter of the
  previous word.  Play  ends when a player uses all of their cards and calls "Stop!",
  or when all  players pass.  Players score points for letters in words, and lose
  points  for leftover letters.  The game is tense, frenetic, and fun. AlphaRummy
  500This is rummy for Alpha cards.  Melds  are made by making words of 4 letters
  or more, with bonus multipliers for longer  words.  You can also play cards on existing
  words to make new words.   My wife Julie and I played this one and had a blast -
  we expect to play it  again. SummaryIf you would like a "portable Scrabble" that
  can  be played quickly and is easier to teach kids, get this game!  I strongly  recommend
  it for educators and home schoolers.  The price is right and you  might even enjoy
  designing your own games.
