<p>Hard to imagine how a football season could turn out any better for our family (other than the Cowboys missing the playoffs this year).  Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacob's high school team won the Oregon 5A state championship with an overtime field goal. You can watch a low-fidelity capture of the game <a href="http://www.osaa.tv/events/13589">over at OSAA TV</a>.</li>
<li>Matthew's youth team won their championship (this is the team I help coach).  This was our fourth straight visit to the championship game and our first time bringing home the trophy.  Matthew capped off a great season by leading his team in tackles and scoring two touchdowns in the game. Additionally, the <em>other</em> Sherwood 8th grade team also won their championship, meaning 2 of the 4 8th grade champions in the Tualatin Valley were Sherwood.  To the best of our knowledge this has never happened before.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just shipped the highlight video for Matthew's team - be warned that it is 30 minutes long.  Matthew is #56.</p>
