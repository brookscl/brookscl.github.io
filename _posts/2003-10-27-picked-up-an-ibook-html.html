excerpt: 'I found a good price on a used iBook here in town, so Jacob and I went to
  check it out on Saturday morning before his football game.  There were a few reasons
  for picking this up:   A good platform for experimenting with Rotor and Mono.  OSX
  / Panther / Jaguar just seemed too cool to miss out on.  I think it will be a better
  home for my iPod link and iTunes.  I wanted a personal laptop for travel, especially
  for important tasks like playing DVDs for the boys on road trips. So far I love
  it.  I''m playing with some different software configurations (browser, office tools,
  etc.) to see what works best.  One disappointment - OpenOffice supposedly works,
  but isn''t a native Mac OSX application (it runs under X11).  It also didn''t work
  in a turnkey maner, probably because I''m not using Darwin as my X11 server. '
