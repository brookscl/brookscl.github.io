excerpt: Chris Palermo does an amazing job with INDEPTH, the free PDF gaming magazine
  from the Long Island Boardgamers.  I worked with Chris on setting up an RSS feed
  for the magazine, and it is up and working.  If your feed reader supports auto-downloading
  of enclosures you can aggregate the PDF files right onto your desktop.
