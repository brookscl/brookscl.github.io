<p>I forgot to mention we spent Monday afternoon at the nearby Red Canyon district of the Dixie National Forest. We expected some second rate trails but were blown away by the castle wall and buckhorn trails. This area doesnâ€™t get a lot of hiker attention because of nearby Bryce but is well worth it. Some tough up and down made this four mile trek challenging and rewarding.</p>
