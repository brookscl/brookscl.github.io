excerpt: 'If all goes well today, there will be a barrage of postings as I clear out
  the backlog.  It was a busy week and I just didn''t have time to touch up and post
  some photos from various events:  The chess tournament last weekend  Some informal
  game playing with the family  A game night we held last Wednesday  A wrestling tournament
  yesterday  Some more game playing this weekend Let''s get things started with the
  chess tournament.        Here I am giving a pep talk to the team before our first
  round of matches.  Julie and Laurie Hill are the other two coaches.  The kids were
  all very nervous.          Nick Rowlands (right) stares down his opponent.  Nick,
  one of Jacob''s best friends, is a tough competitor and a very strong chess player. 
  He and Jacob were on the team that one the bronze medal.          Matthew (r) plays
  a warmup game against his good friend and team captain Cameron Gilmer (l).          The
  unspoken truth about scholastic chess tournaments is that most of the time is spent
  waiting.  And waiting.  What was especially frustrating about this match was that
  the unrated division had to wait until the top division finished their matches,
  often creating a 1.5 - 2 hour gap between games.'
