<p>Let’s try something new.</p>
<h3 id="whatimdrinking">What I’m Drinking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tried the beer Kapuziner Hefe-Weißbier at <a href="http://www.handandfoot.co">Hand + Foot</a> on June 01 2017. Gave it a rating of 4. Great lunchtime beer; refreshing and rich. Hand + Foot is a cool little bistro in the market district in Corning, NY. We were in the area to do some grocery shopping.</li>
<li>Julie and I purchased a “<a href="http://www.steubenbrewingcompany.com/steuben-brewing-beer-share/">beer share</a>” (!) at <a href="http://www.steubenbrewingcompany.com">Steuben Brewing Company</a> which is just up the hill from us here at Keuka Lake. For $36 we get 6 fills of a 750 ml wine bottle style growler, which is a good size for the two of us. Unfortunately the only way we get notified about new beers that are ready is on Facebook, which…</li>
<li>In honor of the passing of Roger Moore, I made a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/17/how-make-dry-martini-roger-moore-way-james-bond">martini last weekend using his recipe</a>. I used a different vermouth, but it didn’t matter - tasted awesome. Putting the drink back in the freezer is a good way to make sure it is ice cold. I’m going to test to see if keeping the gin in the freezer to start with is just as good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’m still mildly obsessed with <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/243/advanced-squad-leader">Advanced Squad Leader</a> and am looking to play at least once per week on <a href="http://vasl.info">VASL</a> while I’m here at the lake. Played with a new online friend last week and got destroyed playing the <a href="http://www.aslscenarioarchive.com/scenario.php?id=56637">Strayer’s Strays scenario</a>. I have a lot to learn but it is very useful playing experienced players. Want a game? <a href="mailto:chris@chrisbrooks.org">Just drop me a line</a>.</li>
<li>Julie and I are getting in almost nightly two-player gaming. Lately it has been mostly <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173346/7-wonders-duel">7 Wonders Duel</a> which Julie dominates in. We also mix in <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1472/five-crowns">Five Crowns</a>.</li>
<li>We are off to Maine for five days, but on return we plan to play <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolk-mayan-calendar">Tzolk’in</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimwatching">What I’m Watching</h3>
<p>Keuka Lake in May/June means lots of catching up on TV series that Julie and I watch together. So far this is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/">Silicon Valley</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/">House of Cards</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>. We just started watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/">The Leftovers</a>. Four episodes in and we have no idea what is going on, but the journey is fun.</p>
<p>I also watched a few single shot Netflix exclusives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80068327">War Machine (2017)</a> – Not a great film as I couldn’t figure out whether to love Brad Pitt’s performance or laugh at it. Still, a worthwhile satire and statement on the USA approach to counter-insurgency over the past 50 years. Hint: it doesn’t seem to be working.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80133554">Sarah Silverman A Speck of Dust</a> – Julie and I watched this last weekend and enjoyed it. Plenty of laugh-out-loud humor. Sarah is brilliant. She also looks the same today as she did when she was in School of Rock.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h3>
<p>I read and recommend a ton of long- and short-form articles every week. <a href="https://getpocket.com/@chris-chrisbrooks">Follow me on Pocket</a> to track what I’m reading there. For those of you interested in leadership and tech industry articles, you might want to see my <a href="http://techleaderlevelup.com/sunday-assorted-links-2/">weekly Sunday links posting</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29396.Furies_of_Calderon">Furies of Calderon</a> – I needed some light fantasy for the summer and this fits the bill perfectly. Just about everyone I know has already read this series. Action packed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/777.Buddhism_Is_Not_What_You_Think">Buddhism Is Not What You Think: Finding Freedom Beyond Beliefs</a> – Hard to spend time in SE Asia and not get curious about Buddhism. What if you strip out the mysticism and theology?</li>
</ul>
