excerpt: 'I’ve been very slow to provide weblog updates lately.  I’m sure one reason
  is that it seems that within 8 hours or so of a session I hold, 2 other people have
  blogged the same session better than I ever could, so why bother.  Maybe I should
  just stick to posting photos!  I remember a time when I was one of about 5 or 6
  boardgame webloggers out there and I thought an interesting hook might be nice photos
  of gaming sessions.  Now there are 10+ gaming podcasts alone, including a high quality
  video podcast, and probably over a 100 weblogs related to boardgames.  I gotta find
  a new niche or just keep reminding myself that I do this primarily for myself. Spring
  is always a busy season for our family as both boys continue to play competitive
  baseball with very demanding practice and game schedules.  We spent last weekend
  in the greater Bend / Sunriver area for our annual baseball tournament weekend. 
  Matthew had 5 games in La Pine, while Jacob had 5 in Bend.  Much driving commenced
  between those two towns (fortunately Sunriver is in the middle) but their schedules
  were mostly agreeable, causing me to miss only one of Jacob’s games. Jacob continues
  to shine as a catcher and first baseman.  His fielding skills in those positions
  are excellent and his hitting continues to improve.  He has a very high on-base
  percentage – he’s a disciplined hitter and gets a lot of walks for someone his size
  (over 5’ 4” as an 11–year-old).  The pitching is starting to get much more challenging,
  with some kids throwing in the 65–70 range with some real junk (curves and change-ups).  Matthew
  is in his second year at the Midget level (he’s got one more year there) and is
  playing at the same level that Jacob did for the past two years.  He’s mostly pitching
  and playing first base, and is the strongest hitter on his team this year.  Oh yeah,
  I’m head coach for Matthew’s team this year.  After helping out with Jacob’s team
  last year, I decided to take the plunge and step up to coach a Midget team myself. 
  I’ve got two great assistants and the boys are having a blast.  We’ve had good pre-season
  tournaments but are currently 0–2 in our league play – we’ve seen two really tough
  teams so far.  This week has back-to-back-to-back games Tue-Wed-Thu so I’m hoping
  the team can climb back towards .500. '
