excerpt: 'Time to catch up on some session reports.  I had some good gaming activity
  over the weekend, starting with a Friday lunchtime session at work.  Side note:
  I''m sitting here in a hotel in California (Huntington Beach) and it looks like
  I''m on the edge of hurricane here.  There''s some serious wind blowing, driving
  rains, and the palm trees are leaning to the north about 10 deg.  Can''t wait to
  get back to Oregon, land of everlasting sunshine and blue skies. Back to gaming:
  Eric, Arron, Paul, Jason, and I sat down for a game of Acquire.  I love this game
  and it was on my short list of games to suggest for five players that could be played
  in about 90 minutes (the other was Through the Desert, which I''m sure we''ll get
  to soon).  Funny enough, only Eric had even heard of Acquire before. Acquire is
  a game of corporate acquisition and, in the paraphrased words of Eric Landes, “just
  might be the best game ever from an American designer.”  He''s speaking, of course,
  of Sid Sackson.  Alan Moon, though, is certainly giving him a run for his money. 
  The game is easy to learn, just makes sense when you are playing it, is a decent
  lesson in cash flow and investments, and is a must-have for serious and casual gamers
  alike. I had the benefit of sitting to the left of the three newbies, with Eric
  sitting to my left (I suspect Eric has played the game quite a bit more than I have;
  this was probably my 6th playing).  Somehow I managed to participate as the major
  or minor leading shareholder in every single acquisition that happened, leading
  to a fairly lopsided game:  Eric: Cash (15,200) + Stock (18,600) = $33,800 Paul: Cash
  (21,200) + Stock (13,300) = $35,500 Jason: Cash (17,000) + Stock (14,100) = $31,100
  Arron: Cash (19,900) + Stock (6,400) = $26,300 Chris: Cash (36,900) + Stock (9,900)
  = $46,800 I played well for sure, but early on Paul and Arron were a bit confused
  about acquisition rules and payoffs and set me up for some nice cashouts.  I''m
  sure it will be a tighter race next time we play.'
