excerpt: For the thousands of you that check my weblog daily (OK, the 3-5 of you),
  you obviously noticed I was down for a while.  My ISP (Stormhosts - great prices
  for ASP.NET hosting) had a major outage, presumably caused by the blast virus outback. 
  In any case, I'm back. Busy week of travel - two days in Charlotte last week, one
  day in San Francisco on Monday, and just got back from Phoenix tonight after a 24
  hour round-trip.
