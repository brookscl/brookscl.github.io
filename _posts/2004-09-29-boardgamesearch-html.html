excerpt: 'BoardGameSearch is a useful site for searching prices for online games. 
  This is a good start, but I want more (actually, my friend George wants more and
  I agree with him): scrape the sites rather than frame them in, then present the
  prices in a list.  Sort of a Froogle for board games.  Froogle already does a decent
  job here, but it needs to index more retailers.'
