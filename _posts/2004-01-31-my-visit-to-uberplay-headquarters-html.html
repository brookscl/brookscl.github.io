excerpt: On my way home to Portland from Seattle on Thursday, I stopped by the Uberplay
  Entertainment headquarters in Issaquah.  Almost a year ago Jeremy Young, invited
  me to come see his crew and some of the great things they were getting ready to
  ship.  That certainly turned out to be a prophetic statement, since they had a banner
  year.  New England won the Games Magazine “Game of the Year 2004” award and Wildlife
  won “Advanced Strategy Game of the Year 2004” so they are clearly on a roll. I love
  visiting game manufacturers - there is such a spirit of entrepreneurism at this
  companies.  Many do it as a labor of love and are fortunate to break even or take
  a small profit.  I get the clear sense that Uberplay has loftier goals, and given
  the talent they have at the helm (Jeremy, Matt Molen, and Guido Teuber) they have
  a great shot at achieving their goals.  Ultimately their business will succeed or
  fail based not only on the quality of the games they produce, but also the quality
  of their marketing strategy.  I think their approach of marketing to the broad religious
  sector and narrower (but still huge) Mormon market (Inspiration Games) is brilliant. 
  Believe me, they are selling many more copies of The Settlers of Zarahemla than
  they are New England.  That's fine by me - though I have no interest in playing
  the Mormon-themed games, if those sales can underwrite new mass appeal boardgames
  then we all win. I asked Jeremy if I could show them KC Humphrey's New Eden prototype
  to solicit feedback, and he gracefully obliged.  Guido, Jeremy, and I sat down for
  a partial game so that I could explain the theme and mechanics.  I am grateful for
  their time and attention and they were able to provide some very valuable feedback
  that I am taking to KC.        Guido and Jeremy give New Eden a try. Unfortunately
  I was unable to get my hands on any of their upcoming new releases (Oasis and Tongiaki
  in particular) - they needed all of their available copies for the upcoming Toy
  Fair in NYC.  I did get a nice consolation prize though - Jeremy donated a slightly
  damaged copy of Ark of the Covenant, a nice variant of Carcassonne.
