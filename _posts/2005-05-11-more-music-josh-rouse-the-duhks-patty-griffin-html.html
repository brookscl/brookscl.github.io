excerpt: 'Been listening to some good music lately, so here''s a follow up to my music
  post from late last year.  Josh Rouse''s Nashville - wow, I didn''t expect to see
  Rouse improve on 1972, but this album is a masterpiece and has been on constant
  rotation for me over the past 2 months.  Favorite tracks: "Streetlights", "It''s
  the Nighttime", and "Sad Eyes." The Duhks - it''s hard to categorize this eclectic
  band from Manitoba - think bluegrass, folk, soul, with some latin beats mixed in. 
  Favorite tracks: "Four Blue Walls", "Everybody Knows", and "True Religion". Patty
  Griffin''s Impossible Dream - Her debut Living with Ghosts is one our family favorites
  and I figured it was time to see what she''s been up to lately.  There''s some good
  material here but it will take a few more listens for me to solidify an opinion. 
  Favorite tracks: "Kite Song", "Top of the World".'
