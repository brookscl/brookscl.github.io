excerpt: 'The better of day 3 at Game Storm for me was my Uberplay Games demonstration
  session, which was supposed to last from nine until noon but actually lasted for
  most of the day.  I''ll cover the details of the demos in my next report, but first
  I thought I would give a photo diary of the other activities of the day.        We
  arrived about 8:30am.  While I set up the Uberplay demos, Jacob and Matthew joined
  in a game of the classic Scotland Yard.        KC promised Jacob and Matthew that
  he would have a special gift for them if they came to Game Storm on Sunday for his
  annual “Family German Games” session.  KC did not disappoint - check out the Battle
  Dome game he found for them!  Think of Hungry Hippos or Gnip Gnop but with pinball
  flippers and a cool, wind-up ball distribution mechanism.        The obligatory
  Loopin'' Louie game.        Jacob and Matthew play The Legend of Landlock with a
  cute little girl.        KC demonstrates one of his better prototypes (with a new
  graphic design!): Pizzza.        Schrille Stille was the highlight of the day for
  me.  Players take the part of a record label pulling strings to boost artists to
  new levels of fame or send them hiking.        So we did I like Schrille Stille
  so much?  I have a thing for cool play mechanisms (not abstract game mechanisms,
  but real gadgets that do something useful in a game), like the tower in Wallenstein. 
  Schrille Stille has this cool cd-player gadget that is used to secretly collect
  and distribute votes for the artists.  Matthew (surprise) was able to trounce everyone
  else.'
