excerpt: 'After returning from the beach on Sunday afternoon, Jacob suggested we give
  Wizard Kings a try.  I love the block game format and picked this up on eBay with
  the hope that Jacob might be drawn to it because of the theme.  We played a short
  introductory scenario with just two boards and with the standard armies supplied
  in the basic game         Jacob prepares to move his elf army. The rules were very
  easy to learn (Jacob taught me this time), especially having just played Gettysburg:
  Badges of Courage which has the same basic mechanics but is quite a bit more complex.
  Jacob is still learning some of the basics of strategy and tactics with these block
  games and is a bit too aggressive in his attacks.  I pummeled him pretty hard just
  sitting back and defending, then built a dragon and started swoopoing into his cities
  and cutting into his production.  I won very easily but I''m sure he''ll give me
  a stronger match next time.  Thumbs up on this one and I look forward to trying
  this with some more chaos units mixed in. Last Tuesday night I hosted the RipCity
  folks as part of a new rotation we are doing.  I argued for some more events on
  the southwest side (mostly Mike Deans and myself) and for some mid-week choices
  besides Thursday.  Of course this means I need to get on the hosting rotation which
  I''m happy to do, though scheduling can be tough with my travel schedule. Doug,
  Mike, and Jake joined me, and Doug suggested and brought Candamir.  This is a Klaus
  Teuber game set in the Settlers of Catan universe, but it borrows very little from
  that series other than some trading.  Of the games I''ve played lately this is most
  like Runebound - a sort of role-playing game where you build up your character by
  going on quests and collecting goods. There are some nice elements to the game -
  the theme is interesting and it was nice to see a game like this not set in a typical
  dungeons and dragons universe.  There are some strategic elements to the game as
  players can compete for dominance in certain areas on a main board which allows
  for some longer-range planning (but not much) and light tension, but overall the
  game was too long.  Maybe it is better with three players (I had exactly the same
  feedback on Runebound and would never play it again with four players).  I think
  everyone was ready to be done with an hour still left in the game.  Downtime isn''t
  terrible but can be a factor, and it is much harder to "pipeline" player moves in
  this game than it is in Runebound (we always play with the next player making his
  dice roll right after the current player chooses his move).         Doug, Mike,
  Jake, and I play Candamir. There is also very little player interaction in the game
  despite the ability for players to trade with each other.  The game has great production
  elements though and I''d like to try it again with only 2 or 3 players to see if
  it can be played in 90-120 minutes (our game took about 3.5 hours).  In this genre,
  however, I think I prefer Runebound.'
