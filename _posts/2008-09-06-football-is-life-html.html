excerpt: 'Or at least it seems that way this time of year, though no regrets. My typical
  day these days: up at 5:30am, carpool downtown at 6:30am, work until about 4pm,
  then to football practice until 8:30pm. Things will lighten up with school back
  in - only 3 practices a week. Both boys have their first games tomorrow, schedule:    Matthew
  (the game I''m coaching) plays 10am - noon    Head to Canby to film and scout our
  next opponent, 2-4pm    Back home for a quick bite then off to Beaverton to watch
  Jacob''s game under the lights, 7pm-9pm  Then on Sunday I get to help coach a fall
  baseball game for the boys 4:45pm - 7pm back up in Beaverton. Hopefully will get
  to do some gaming (of the non-sports type) early Sunday afternoon. Check back soon
  for football photos!'
