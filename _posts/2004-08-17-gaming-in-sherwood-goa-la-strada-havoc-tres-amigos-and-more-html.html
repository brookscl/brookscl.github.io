excerpt: 'We were well overdue for hosting a game day at our house, so we opened our
  home on Sunday to a day of gaming with the ripcity folks and more.  Turnout was
  outstanding - Doug & Mimi, KC & Rita, Kevin Graham, Ken Rude, and Mike Deans were
  all on hand.  Also joining us was Tim Isakson, a recent Portland transplant from
  Dallas.  I gamed with Tim last year in Dallas, and Tim is already well acquainted
  with several folks in my gaming circle.         Jenna and Charisma provided plenty
  of entertainment for Jacob and Matthew.  Here''s their rendition of YMCA after a
  bit of dress-up play. Doug, Mimi, Kevin, and Tim were first to arrive.  I knew several
  others would be arriving shortly, so I set them up with La Strada and explained
  the rules.  This is a very easy game to teach and is quite enjoyable (I''ve played
  it once so far), and response was favorable from the crew.  The usual first reaction
  when someone finishes this game is “wow, I can''t believe it''s over already.” 
  It does play very quickly (about 20-30 minutes) and you can''t sit idle waiting
  for your chance to score.  Great enjoyment/time factor in this game though.  Kevin
  was the victor with 26 points.         Kevin (the unknown gamer), Doug, Mimi, and
  Tim finishing up a game of La Strada. KC, Rita, and Kevin arrived shortly after
  I started the La Strada game, and we brought out one of Rita''s favorites: Gold
  Connection (see also this article) by Sid Sackson.  This is a press-your-luck game
  ala Can''t Stop, but with a bit more strategy.  Players cruise around a series of
  gold vaults stealing gold bars and trying to build sets of a particular color (!) of
  gold.  Within a vault, you can choose to steal as much gold as you like, but you
  must roll two dice and get a number higher than the sum of the face values on the
  gold bars plus the distance from your starting location.  So if I''m 1 space away,
  and want to steal two bars of gold with 1 & 2, I need to roll a 4 (1 + 1 + 2). 
  If you are successful, you get to add these to your collection.  Fail and you not
  only lose those but any others you''ve accumulated this turn.  You do get a consolation
  token if you fail, which can later be used to add to a die roll.         Ken, KC,
  Rita and I play Gold Connection as Julie looks on. There''s a bit more to the game
  than that, particularly around the scoring and building sequences within a color,
  but you get the idea.  I was the winner this time.  Very much a luck-driven game,
  but the same tension found in Can''t Stop and I''d love to play this one again.         Doug,
  Mimi, Tim, and Kevin played Desert Oasis next.  This is a solid game with 4 or 5
  players.  I taught this one to the group as nobody had played before; Doug pulled
  out the victory. Ken, Julie, KC, Rita and I then played KC''s card game Tres Amigos
  (and here).  KC has made some great tweaks to this Euchre-style trick taking game
  themed with the great Chevy Chase movie.  The reward for going nill (El Guapo) is
  not as high, and the player choosing this must take the turned-up trump card.  This
  makes for a much more balanced game and creates tougher choices.  In one case, I
  had a hand that I was fairly certain would win all the tricks.  The challenge is
  you must bid with the highest card to get the right to score this way, which means
  you are giving up some hand strength.  I didn''t quite bit high enough, and Rita
  was able to overbid me and try and go for El Guapo.  With my hand as strong as it
  was, it was a sure thing for her.  In hindsight I should have layed down one of
  my higher cards; I take it out of the game and would still have taken 4 tricks easily. 
  I still managed to win the game, though it was very close.         Tres Amigos!         Rita,
  Kevin, Mimi, Julie, and Ken play San Juan.  Ken was the victor. The one game I wanted
  to be sure to play was Goa, the new “gamer''s game” designed by Ruediger Dorn. 
  Goa has had very favorable reviews (currently ranked at about an 8 on the ''geek),
  and has the sort of depth I really like.  Doug, Tim, and KC had all played before;
  Tim apparently A LOT, so I had some good teachers to bring me along. When playing
  a game with this much depth, I typically tune out about half the rules explanation
  at the start, figuring that I''ll learn as I go and folks will help be along the
  way.  There''s a learning curve for this game, but everything makes intuitive sense
  and the pieces fit together nicely. Goa reminds me of Industria and Princes of the
  Renaissance.  Auctions serve as the primary mechanic, and there appear to be many
  routes to victory.  Like Puerto Rico, it seems (first blush - not sure if this has
  proven itself) that a highly adaptive strategy is required.  The best approach most
  likely will not be the same from game to game.  I thought this game was much better
  than Industria though, and at least as good as Princes.  I kept wanting to do more
  on my turn - very tough choices. A fumbled my way through the game and held up reasonably
  well.  Tim was the runaway winner with 43 points, Doug 37, KC 36, and Chris 35. 
  I can''t wait to play this one again - it is at least an 8 for me.         Doug,
  Tim, KC and I played Goa.          I was a bit disappointed to miss out on a playing
  of Princes of Florence, a game that has been sitting unplayed on my shelf for about
  six months.  Kevin was the teacher and the winner.         Mike showed up later
  in the afternoon after refing some soccer.  He challenged Jacob to a home & home
  contest of Memoir ''44.  They played the Sainte Mère-Eglise scenario, alternating
  Axis/Allies.  Jacob won both times.  According to Mike, “Jacob rolled lots of grenades,
  I rolled lots of flags.”  Sure... My final game of the day was a first try at KC''s
  latest card game titled Havoc.  This is the most strategic card game KC has designed,
  and will likely become my favorite.  I hope to get in a few plays at GenCon this
  coming weekend. Players try to build their hands rummy style, trying to produce
  strong poker hands of up to six cards that will be used to fight a series of battles
  (the backdrop is the 100 years war).  At any time on a player''s turn, he can cry
  havoc and engage in the next battle.  The winner of the battle will always win victory
  points, and depending on the battle 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. may also win points.  When
  a havoc is declared, a player must play at least two cards that will end up as all
  or part of their poker hand.  Each player in turn then either passes or lays down
  at least two cards.  If a player opts out of the battle, he draws a card as consolation. 
  Once all players pass, the played cards are compared for the best poker hand (6
  card straight flush, 6 of a kind, etc. all the way down to high card).  The best
  hand wins the battle. KC also added an interesting twist - the “dogs of war”.  In
  the midst of a battle, a player may play a special dog card that doesn''t count
  toward the player''s hand, but at the end of the battle can be used to fetch a visible
  card.  A nice addition that adds a strategic element. Our game was close - KC finished
  with 27, Chris 26, Tim 17, and Doug 13.         Doug, Tim, KC, and Chris cry Havoc.         Ken,
  Rita, Mimi, and Mike play Too Many Cooks.  This particular round was funny - everyone
  bid to take no tricks!  Ken was the victor.  Well, we were able to able to pack
  in a ton of high quality games in an afternoon.  A nice prep for GenCon - expect
  to see daily reports from me over the weekend.'
