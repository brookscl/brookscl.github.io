excerpt: ' I finally have another release of FreshFish available for download.  I
  think this version looks quite a bit nicer (thanks to Angela for providing some
  updated graphics), and the usability is drastically improved.  Most of the improvements
  though are in the underlying game engine, since I had a number of things wrong with
  rules, end-game, and certain game states in the previous version.  I do still have
  a ways to go though... some other points:  If you don''t know how to play, read
  the rules.  Scott Hanselman sat down for some pair programming with me and gave
  some great advice, most of which made it into this version.  His most striking comment
  was this: "Is it a game or a business application?"  This hit home... the use of
  status bar, menu bar, etc. does make it look too much like an office productivity
  tool.  Expect a makeover in the next release.  I hope the rules are solid in this
  version, since I really would like to move onto networked play.  Please report any
  issues you see. Have fun!'
