excerpt: 'I''ve got a huge backlog of things to post, but my hosting ISP had my home
  blocked out in their firewall so the whole world has been able to see my site but
  not me. We leave tomorrow on a family vacation in the Caribbean.  I might have access
  while away, but most likely you won''t see any new material until Dec 19. One note:
  I''ve been having a BLAST playing on BSW with the kids.  Last week I was out east
  on a business trip and arranged a “play date” with the kids on BSW.  We hooked up
  and played TransAmerica for about 45 minutes.  Since then we''ve also played Power
  Grid, St. Petersburg, and Lost Cities.  I love the BSW Power Grid implementation
  - probably the best I''ve seen there.'
