excerpt: 'These past two weeks have been rather odd for me.  First, I usually take
  around 10 days of vacation around Christmas and New Years.  In fact, I can''t remember
  the last time I worked the week in between Christmas and New Years.  Because we
  did the cruise earlier in the month, I decided to work three days both weeks.  This
  included today, which is my birthday (I''m 0x25 this year).  Second, Julie and the
  boys have been camped out at Salishan for over a week, so I''ve had to take care
  of myself at home which is a frightening prospect.  Fortunately I''ve managed to
  avoid cooking and any serious home maintenance, though I did do a bit of shower
  repair this afternoon. Yesterday Mike Deans held his second annual “first Monday
  after Christmas game day”.  I worked a little more than a half day and arrived at
  Mike''s around 1:30pm.  Chuck, Dave, Doug, and Mike were getting ready to begin
  a game of Air Baron, the Avalon Hill game of airline travel control.  I hadn''t
  heard of the game before but decided to jump in and take the fifth seat.         Chuck,
  Dave, and Mike contemplate their next moves in Air Baron. This game has a very euro
  feel to it for a 90s Avalon Hill game, though there certainly is a decent amount
  of luck.  The basic idea of the game is that players purchase control of routes
  from airline hubs (places I''m all too familiar with such as ORD, DIA, DFW, LAX,
  etc.) to cities served by the hubs.  Some hubs are very valuable (like ORD), while
  others are less so.  As routes are purchased by players, chits for those routes
  are thrown in the “hopper” along with chits for the hubs and a few other random
  event chits.  At the start of each player''s turn, two chits are drawn.  If a route
  is drawn, that player gets a payoff equal to the original cost of the route.  If
  a hub is drawn, all players controlling routes into that hub get a payoff.  If a
  player controls a hub by having a majority of the routes into a hub (or even better,
  controlling all routes into a hub), then the payoff is even greater.  There are
  a few other mechanics to the game, but that''s the basic idea. Player interaction
  comes into play as players attempt to takeover unclaimed routes or those owned by
  others.  Takeovers are the only way players can acquire more than one route in a
  given turn and they become quite frequent after the initial route-grab phase of
  the game completes.  The goal of the game is to achieve a certain level of market
  share, which is determined by hubs that are controlled by a player and the cash
  on hand. Doug had some interesting comments in his writeup of the session:  ...
  the game definitely has a rich-get-richer feel, and had I been on the poorer end
  of the scale in my last two games, I would probably have enjoyed the experience
  less, perhaps much less. As it was, I was happy to have our game end when it did,
  perhaps two or three turns sooner would have been even better even had it not been
  me. I tend to agree with Doug in that I felt that for most of the game I was out
  of contention and just trying to play spoiler.  The luck of the roll (when doing
  takeovers) or the draw (if some of your big routes, particular internationals) can
  certainly swing things quickly though, and there was tremendous tension towards
  the end of the game.  Chuck was within 1 point of winning the game (out of 320 I
  believe) but couldn''t quite pull it out; Doug pulled out a victory a turn or two
  later. Not a great game but certainly a very good game, and one I would certainly
  play again. Next up was Die Sieben Siegal, the innovative trick taking card game
  that I first played last year down in New Orleans.  I had been eager to play this
  one again - it reminds me of spades, a game I played frequently growing up, though
  Die Sieben Siegel requires much better precision in bidding.  The game was close,
  but I believe Mike came away with the victory edging out Dave. Chuck had 90 minutes
  or so before he needed to leave, so we brought out Alhambra.  This game confuses
  me.  It feels like it plays on auto pilot and is mostly a luckfest (I''m sure there
  are strong players out there that win consistently, but it still feels that way
  to me) but I always enjoy the ride.         KC, Chuck, Ken, and I lay out our patio
  furniture in Alhambra. Chuck played a strong game, building a very long city (chitty?)
  wall and winning by a healthy margin.          Dave, KC, and Rita played Stephenson''s
  Rocket.  I''ve never seen this game though I''ve read about it quite a bit. Mike
  suggested Industria, and I wanted to give it another try after my first ho-hum encounter
  with it at Gamestorm this year.  This is a thinking game, and I must give credit
  to the graphic designer - I think the game is a pleasure to look at.  I think the
  game is lacking a plot line - there''s no real phasing of the game, no climax. 
  Each round feels about the same, you do your best, then you see what the score is
  at the end.  It was a fun ride, but given the same amount of time I would rather
  play the much better Power Grid.          Ken, Mike, and I played Industria. I focused
  on getting bonus points from linkages and didn''t pursue any of the special tile
  marker bonuses.  Turned out to be a decent strategy as I won the game.  Somehow
  I ended up with a pile of money towards the end, allowing me to bribe Mike into
  selling me a tech tile that gave me two more linkages.  I think I would have won
  the game anyway, but it was fun seeing him sell it for 7 while Ken''s ears turned
  red. Tonight I was facing an evening at home alone on my birthday (we''ll celebrate
  tomorrow night out at Salishan), but a call mid-day from Ken made my day - the Rudes
  invited me over for dinner.  Ken, Brandon, and I were planning on getting together
  for some gaming tonight anyway, but the added surprise of dinner and desert was
  a very kind gesture on their part.  Ken is an OSU alumnus, so was as eager as I
  to watch the Insight Bowl while gaming - the Beavers handed Notre Dame another crushing
  bowl defeat, so all is good in the sports world for me right now.  All I need is
  for Iowa to win on Saturday, the Colts to win the Superbowl, and the Pacers to rebound
  and win the NBA.  I''ll be happy with 2 out of 3. Ken requested Entdecker, the exploration
  game designed by Klaus Teuber.  I''ve had this game for a while but hadn''t played
  yet.          Brandon, Ken, and I explore the great unknown seas in Entdecker. 
  This game has an awesome scoring track (the serpent on the top of the board). This
  game has a lot of similarities to the Carcassonne series, though is quite a bit
  deeper (and longer).  Unfortunately we played incorrectly: 2/3 of the way through
  the game, Ken mentioned that we forgot the toll-paying rule when you explore along
  a route that passes through a tile with a player marker on it.  I doubt the outcome
  would have changed (Ken crushed us, and I finished last), but the money dynamic
  early in the game certainly would have been different. I made the mistake of not
  get enough completed smaller islands early in the game, and I was very under-represented
  in the villager tracks competing for the end-game prizes.  Ken had a very lucky
  draw at the end that took away a majority on a large bonus-tile island that gave
  him the runaway lead.  Had a I won it the game would have been a bit closer, but
  Ken had the game in the bag.  I definitely want to play this one again and will
  try and get it out this weekend. I work my last day this week tomorrow then head
  out to Salishan to rejoin the family.  The Rudes and the Humphreys will join us
  out there for an extended New Years celebration weekend.  There will be a decent
  amount of gaming so I''ll try and post as the weekend goes by.'
