excerpt: 'Today was day 1 for GameStorm in Portland, OR.  I had to get there by 4pm
  to hand deliver KC''s New Eden prototype; I thought I gave myself plenty of travel
  time, but an accident on I-5 cut things close and I arrived just in time.  KC was
  just beginning to explain the rules to New Eden to a group of gamers eager to give
  it a try.  I added some commentary here and there and it appeared to come off without
  a hitch.        KC teaches a group how to play New Eden. Meanwhile Mike Deans arrived
  so we decided to sit down and play.  First was an aborted attempt to play Oasis,
  but unfortunately we couldn''t find a third player.  Fancy that happening at a gaming
  convention.  So we settled for Odin''s Ravens, which I hadn''t played before.  Fun
  game!  Clearly a bit luck driven, because I managed to beat Mike soundly.        Mike
  Deans taught me how to play Odin''s Ravens. While teaching New Eden, KC was spending
  some time mounting and preparing the bits for a new game prototype.  More about
  this later.        KC multi-tasking.  While teaching people how to play an existing
  prototype, he is also able to design a new prototype in his head while mounting
  a third prototype. I was surprised at the amount of gaming already happening when
  I arrived at 4pm.  Dave and Doug were immersed in a series of Knizia games.  Apparently
  there is a Kniziathon tournament with weighted scoring (based on game complexity
  or length).        Dave and Doug participated in the “Kniziathon” tournament.  Here
  they are playing Rome: Circus Maximus. After a brief dinner with the gang, I sat
  down for a scheduled game of Industria, the relatively new Michael Schact game. 
  This has received some glowing reviews so I was eager to try it.  The art work and
  board design is very nice, and the game play was fun.  This is an auction game where
  players bid to win the right to build a building, upgrade a technology, or gain
  a resource.  There are a number of ways to gain victory points - some buildings
  have them inherently, tech upgrades, and bonuses.  Bonuses come in the form of linkages
  between purchases (based on adjacency - for example, there may be two linked upgrades
  that, if you managed to get both, would give you a three point bonus), or categories
  or buildings that give extra VPs.        I managed to play one scheduled game tonight:
  Industria, hosted by Lorna. Everyone missed a crucial rule that hurt me for one
  turn and may have put me in last place instead of third (heh): when a player acting
  as the auctioneer doesn''t win an auction, they remain the auctioneer for the next
  item.  In one case, we passed the auctioneer on to the next player.  This can hurt
  quite a bit since it can deprive a player of income or a discounted building.  No
  big deal since this was a learning game.  There are a few things I didn''t like
  about the game, mostly related to auctions with goods that were utterly worthless. 
  I would definitely play this again though.        George and Dave patiently wait
  for a third player to join them in a game of der Weiße Lotus.  Unfortunately this
  never happend. KC and Jay ran a two-player swiss style tournament tonight, and I
  donated a few games to fill out their inventory and lurked for a while to help with
  the rules.        KC and Jay ran a two-player swiss-style tournament tonight. A
  wide range of games were played in the tournament, including Lost Cities, Odin''s
  Ravens, and Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation.        Mike helps teach a new
  player Lost Cities. At the end of the evening KC taught George and I how to play
  his newest prototype, a fairly abstract name tentatively called Cairo after the
  style of tiles used in the game.  More about this game later, but it was very enjoyable
  to play.  Tactical, plenty of random elements, but genuinely fun.        My evening
  wrapped up with a play of yet another great KC prototype, tentatively named “Cairo”.'
