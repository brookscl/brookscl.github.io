excerpt: Day 3 (Saturday) was our last full day in London, and the weather started
  to turn cold and windy. This would be the trend for the next 5 days or so in the
  UK and western Europe, with a high likelihood of snow in many of those parts. After
  a quick pastry breakfast and coffee near our Underground stop, we headed down to
  the Tower of London to explore the castle and take advantage of the free Yeoman
  / Beefeater tour. We arrived early as planned and walked onto the grounds before
  the crowds started building up (remember, this was the Saturday between Good Friday
  and Easter) and proceeded directly to the crown jewels. This was probably a good
  idea as we saw how long the lines must get there when crowded - it was nice to be
  able to zoom through the switchbacks and get right to the good stuff. Some big diamonds
  in there, but more impressive was the vast collection of medieval weaponry and armor.
  Unfortunately Jacob started turning ill that morning and as the time came to depart
  for our Beatles walking tour, Julie and Jacob opted to stay behind and explore the
  torture exhibits a bit more then return to our hotel room. Dave, Lisa, Matthew and
  I then raced across town to try and join the London Walks - Beatles In My Life Walk
  with guide Richard Porter. I've done London Walks twice - once in 1990 as a pub
  crawl, and now in 2008, and I highly recommend them for the value and experience.
  We were very fortunate as we arrived at the station 15 minutes late but caught the
  group just as they were leaving. We saw a number of great sites, though none were
  visually recognizable to me other than the final stop at Abbey Road Studios. Of
  course I took the obligatory photograph. Matthew decided to keep his shoes on. Our
  final touring destination of the day was to walk in the Westminster, Buckingham
  Palace, and Whitehall area to take in some of the famous buildings and pound the
  pavement a bit. The weather was getting very blustery by now so on the Whitehall
  portion of the walk we stopped into a book store with a nice coffee cafe inside
  and had some giant cappuccinos and hot chocolates along with a much needed foot
  rest. We left Jacob in the room for our dinner Saturday evening with Mikael Sheik
  (of SpielByWeb fame) and his wife Phyllis. We opted once again for Indian food close
  to home in Bloomsbury. While the food wasn't as good as the night before, the company
  was outstanding and we enjoyed catching up and learning more about living in London.
  We retired early Saturday night to pack and prepare for our early morning Eurostar
  ride into Belgium.
