excerpt: 'It should be easier than this. I thought I had a decent Rails installation
  running on my MacBook Pro but TextMate was giving me some grief when shelling out
  to execute certain commands (like pulling down the schema for a model). This worried
  me - my environment seemed OK, but if TextMate was failing then there''s likely
  some other lurking problem. It took me about 2 hours to unwind everything and get
  my environment working so that I could see this.  The root cause? I''m not 100%
  sure, but here are a few hypothesis:    I had a mixed MacPorts and Leopard install
  of Ruby and Rails    I likely had some path issue that I cleaned up, causing gems
  to not be found like they should    I had some strange mixtures of legacy and new
  ports installed that needed some serious work to clean up.  I think the concept
  of MacPorts is good, but in reality it shouldn''t be this hard. My experience with
  apt-get on Ubuntu was about 100% better. Oh well, all is good now. I absolutely
  love the new TextMate Rails 2 bundle.'
