excerpt: "                            I’m working on an online version of the game
  Fresh Fish             by Friedemann Friese.              Some folks have asked
  to see early versions of the source code, particularly the expropriation             algorithm.
   I’ll post more thoughts on the design and implementation right             here
  in a sort of development diary, so stay tuned.  You can download the source right
  \            here.               "
