excerpt: Some quick thoughts on two games I got to play tonight - Notre Dame (finally!)
  and Hanging Gardens. KC, Rita, Ian, Mike and I first played a five player game of
  Notre Dame, a game I "won" in a secret Santa trade last December but hadn't managed
  to play yet. I had heard mixed but mostly positive reviews on the game as well as
  varying reports on play length. We played in a little over an hour after learning
  and I quite like it. There seem to be multiple paths to victory and enough competition
  / interaction to keep you on your toes. Balancing the rat and plague problem was
  a quandary - I think sometimes you just have to take your medicine. The cycling
  of the cards ensures that you'll have a wide range of options so you can actually
  strategize a bit, though the timing can interfere with those plans. I think this
  is a 7-8 rating for me, especially if I can play it in 45 minutes with 3 players.
  Hanging Gardens is an interesting puzzle and set collection game where you draft
  cards with symbols that overlay on your garden. The goal is to get contiguous orthogonal
  sets of like symbols together that then allow you to claim the tiles you are collecting.
  Very easy to learn and decent fun, but I have a problem with how many tiles were
  left at the end of the game when the cards were exhausted. This makes planning very
  difficult as there are limited sets and for some (like the tiles where there are
  only 4), the odds seem pretty good that you will only see 2 of the 4 in the game.
  Not a bad game, but there plenty of other games of this weight that I would play
  ahead of it.
