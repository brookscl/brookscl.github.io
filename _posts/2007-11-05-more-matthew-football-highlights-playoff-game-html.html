excerpt: " Matthew's team won a hard-fought contest 16-0 on Saturday against a team
  that beat them in the regular season to earn a spot in the championship.  Unfortunately,
  Jacob's team lost a nailbiter 7-6 on a final minute score by the opposing team,
  so his season ends one game short of the championship.  Matthew scored both touchdowns
  in his team's win, so here are the highlights.  "
