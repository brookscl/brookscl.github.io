excerpt: 'Yesterday was the first day of school for Jacob (4th grade) and Matthew
  (2nd grade).  Jacob was a bit stressed for most of the weekend, and Matthew in typical
  second-born nature queried the night before “I wonder if I''ll remember when I wake
  up in the morning that it''s the first day of school?”  They both have great teachers
  and we''re looking forward to more success inside and outside the classroom this
  school year.            '
