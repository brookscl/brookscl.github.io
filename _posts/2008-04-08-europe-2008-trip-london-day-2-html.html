excerpt: Where can you get a cup of coffee at 6am in London? I set out to answer that
  question on Friday morning after waking up bright and bushy tailed at 5am (8 hours
  of sleep - woot!). I thought the quick stop joints near the Russell Square Underground
  would be a sure bet (Pret a Manger, local breakfast spot, etc.) but alas nothing
  seems to open until 7am. I had nothing better to do than roam and explore so I worked
  my way outward from the hotel in concentric circles until I happened upon a young
  adult tour group loading on a bus at one of the large budget hotels near our Holiday
  Inn. The hotel opened their coffee cafe to service these tourists as they checked
  out and loaded on the bus, so I slid in line and got my well earned coffee. I sat
  down in the cafe, which proceeded to close shop as the tour bus departed. I suppose
  I should consider myself lucky. I wonder if Starbucks in London is open at 6am?
  After returning to the room about 7am to wake up Julie and the boys, we headed to
  the lobby for a rendezvous with Iain Cheyne and his lovely family for a breakfast
  date. The goal was to find a good old English breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage,
  tomatoes, and beans. I continue to be amazed with how adventurous the boys are an
  they ordered right off the menu and went for the whole shebang.   Iain is one of
  those people that I feel like I know and relate to extremely well, but we've had
  about 90 minutes total of face time in our lifetimes. I believe we met briefly at
  Essen in 2006 but never found time to sit down and play a game together, so it was
  nice to finally sit down, meet the family (that's Oscar you see in the background),
  and talk about life, work, travel, and more. Jacob owned the planning for Friday
  and he set us off across the Thames to visit the Imperial War Museum, my all-time
  favorite museum in the world. Seriously. This museum has a great gallery with a
  wide range of aircraft, tanks, SP guns, half-tracks, and more - everything is pretty
  much from the 20th century with a sharp focus on WWI and WWII. While fun to look
  at and explore, the static displays are not where it is at in this museum. There
  are three areas you must explore in this museum. The WWI exhibit features a chronological
  history of the conflict with great artifacts, photos, and video to guide. There
  is also the dated but still interesting trench experience (check out the Flickr
  photo set for more photos of these exhibits). The UK's level of commitment and sacrifice
  in these two wars was on a different plane than the US and I particularly enjoy
  the English flavor and perspective - war posters, ration signs, newspaper stories,
  and news film. The WWII exhibit is the best I've seen anywhere - in fact, where
  in the US can you find a museum exhibit that covers the conflict from soup-to-nuts
  across all armed forces? I haven't seen such a thing and would love pointers from
  readers to museums I've missed, as everything I've seen has been service-focused
  (Air Force museum, Army division museums, etc.). Similar to the trench experience,
  you can find the London blitz experience in this area. It seemed more interesting
  in 1990 when I first visited the museum. Finally, the Holocaust exhibit in the Imperial
  War Museum is the best I've seen anywhere. This exhibit does not pull punches and
  is not for smaller kids or the faint of heart, but I felt it was important for both
  boys to see the photos, hear the survivor narratives, and understand as much as
  any of us can the human tragedy experienced by so many. Needless to say, I probably
  could have spent the whole day (or even two) at the museum, but Jacob was our tour
  director and it was time to move on around 1:30pm. The weather was chilly but clearing
  up when we left the museum to have lunch at the Crown & Cushion pub nearby.  We
  were at least 2-3 hours behind schedule by the time we finished lunch and Jacob
  decided to forgo visiting the operating theater museum so that we could make sure
  we got on the London Eye while the weather was good. The lines looked intimidating
  at first (this was Good Friday so holiday activity from locals and tourists was
  quite high) but we moved through the ticket purchase and Eye line faster than expected,
  about 30 minutes.  Just as we crossed the pathway in line to the covered area before
  boarding the Eye, the storms came in like a hammer - lightning, high winds, and
  a healthy dose of hail set many folks in line to their umbrellas or even running
  away from the line. They shut down the Eye for a while until the lightning subsided
  (we were thankful or that), so by the time we took our turn we had an amazing spectrum
  of light and color or our ride. This was a good choice for early in the trip as
  it gave everyone a better understanding of the topology and city layout. I know
  it is somewhat of a tourist trap, but I think the Eye is a great choice for first-time
  London visitors (similar to climbing the Eiffel Tower in Paris - more on that later).  The
  weather held up after leaving the Eye so we walked across the Jubilee bridge to
  watch the peddlers selling nicknacks and admire the city skyline as the sun set.
  Matthew continued to demonstrate his ability to sleep in just about any position
  or situation.  Before the war museum we had picked up some discount tickets for
  Spamalot (even at a discount I think the cost for the four of us was something like
  $220-$240), the show voted most likely to please the widest range of our travel
  group. We even watched the Holy Grail a day or two before leaving to brush up on
  our ability to quote Monty Python lines at will. We needed food before the late
  show and found a nice Indian restaurant in the theater district, but unfortunately
  it took too long to seat and serve us. We literally had to ask for the check as
  the entrees were delivered and race out of the restaurant gobbling naan as we walked
  to the theater. Typical rude American tourists I guess.  The show was great fun
  or everyone - enough memorable lines and scenes ("bring out your dead", "how do
  you know he's the king?", etc.) to provide a connection to the movie but some great
  songs and theater added to keep you interested. We had hoped for some more pub activity
  after the show, but Good Friday meant our local joints were closing early so we
  ended up retiring around 11pm, eager to sleep and start our final full day in London.
