<p>We had a much better showing on offense this week, gaining over 300 yards with a decent mix of passing and running. It was nice having our starting fullback in the lineup - he broke two plays for about 50 and 95 yards for touchdowns in the first half, breaking the game open. We ran a healthy mix of plays, completing two passes for 50 yards but throwing one interception on a missed WR route.</p>
<p>Our defense was solid and we had a lot of non-starters in the lineup in the second half. St Helens wisely ran their wedge play frequently which was about their only successful play. It was tough to stop and we hadn't drilled technique in practice at all. We were up 33-0 at the time so I didn't get too worked up about it and I don't think we'll see another team this season that will wedge. That said we still had some problems at time with sweep containment so we need to drill that hard this week and even look at some personnel changes in our hawk positions to bolster things. The team we are playing this weekend runs a shotgun spread most of the time so we have a lot of work to do for preparation. They have a talented QB that can run and throw so this will be a good test for our defense.</p>
<p>I'll post a few game highlight videos shortly.</p>
