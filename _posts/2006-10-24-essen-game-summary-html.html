excerpt: 'This year I''d like to give a bit more information about the games I saw
  and played while at Essen.  I''ll do another post where I talk some more about the
  Sunriver Games booth, but this one will just be focused on the games.  Most of you
  know it isn''t my style to go into depth on any one game, so this post will give broad
  strokes across a wide range of games. Fiji  This was the first game I saw played
  at the fair while stopping in on Tuesday to hopefully get started on booth setup. 
  This is one of the latest 2F games and I never got a chance to play it.  The main
  reason: I heard it was almost a pure blind bidding game and one friend indicated
  that she would rather play a simple roll and move game than this one given the chaos
  involved.  Maybe there''s more there than I think, but this is one you should most
  certainly try before you buy. Gloria Mundi  Another game I watched folks play (including
  Valerie Putnam and Lorna Wong - not sure who the other chap was).  This is the collaborative
  release from James Ernest and Mike Selinker and it is essentially a racing game
  with players trying to race to one end of the board while the goths race towards
  Rome.  Players have equivalent decks of cards in their hands that they use to produce
  certain resources that allow them to advance along the track, with the goth movement
  causing certain not-so-good things to happen to those resources.  I hope I got that
  approximately right.  This looks like one I''d like to try. Shogun  All of you Wallenstein
  fans know about this one - the Japanese themed version of the now classic multi-player
  Euro-style war game based in Germany during the 30 years war.  Wallenstein has been
  out of print for a while so many folks who''ve had a chance to play it online at
  Mikael''s spiel-by-web site have been anxiously awaiting this release.  I picked
  up a copy in a trade with Queen games and I''m quite excited.  Here are some differences
  from the original:  A double-sided board.  In the words of Barbara Henn (Dirk''s
  wife), one side is nicer and the other isn''t so nice.  I''m certain nice meant
  "less confrontational" in this context.  There are some new action cards that allowe
  players to directly influence the player order, which was a sometimes significant
  random element in Wallenstein.  The cube tower appears to have a better construction
  than the original, though I''ll need to see it. One interesting piece of information
  I got from Queen was that they are generally releasing three versions of every game:
  German with only German language box and instructions, International A aimed at
  the Americas with English, French, Spanish, and German, and International B aimed
  at central Europe with French, Italian, Dutch, and German. Alhambra the Dice Game  Given
  the wide range of games that are now branded in the Alhambra series we tried to
  convince Queen that "Alhambra the Numeric Domino Tile Laying Game" would be a good
  idea - not sure they bought it.  The new dice game is one I also picked up in the
  trade it looks like a nice dice rolling game that blends some of the Yahtzee mechanics
  with scoring based on the building styles/colors in the original Alhambra game.
  Yspahan  I still feel that I don''t know much about this game other than it is much
  lighter and shorter than its predecessors from Ystari (Caylus, Ys).  Jim Ginn quite
  liked it and I think he bought a copy. Die Saulen von Venedig  AKA the "other Saulen"
  game, I never got a chance to sit down and play or watch this new Gold Sieber release. 
  The board makes it look fairly light but I could be wrong.  Very attractive box
  and bits though. The Thief of Bagdad  The final new Queen release, this is a multi-player
  game where players play both the thieves trying to steal from Sultans (?) and the
  guards trying to prevent the thieves from stealing.  Clearly all sorts of room for
  bribery and corruption and I''m glad I picked up a copy - looks to be fun. Die Siedler
  von Catan: Kampf um Rom  This is another Settlers game with a fixed board that appears
  to introduce a few new mechanics.  Mayfair will have the English version in very
  early 2007. TurfMaster  My single most expensive acquisition over the weekend at
  69 euro, this was an easy decision to buy after checking the ''geek and playing
  a game at their booth.  The component quality is amazing - painted horses, plastic
  deck boxes, and a very attractive double-sided board.  It also supports 2-8 players.
  The game play is very tactical with just enough luck involved to keep things interesting. 
  Each player starts with a shuffled 32-card deck with numbers up to 12 (I''m not
  sure of the distribution).  A game is played over three races, with each player
  drawing 10 cards for each race.  Because the decks are identical, luck of the draw
  should even out over the three races.  The race is run by alternating moves where
  players play a card from their hand to move the indicated number of spaces followed
  by a move where one player rolls 2D6 to determine how all of the horses will move. 
  The player who rolls gets to decide how the dice are used: he can use both dice
  or just one of the two.  This responsibility rotates clockwise so a new player gets
  to choose each time. The game really shines with the handicapping system whereby
  horses in the first three positions are limited in their maximum movement.  This
  means that a hand of all high cards can be a hinderance, because when you play a
  card that is over your handicap limit you move zero spaces instead of the indicated
  number.  This can be devastating towards the end of the race so hand management
  and planning is critical.  Further, if the player rolling the dice chooses a combined
  die roll that is over the handicap limit, the handicapped horse only gets to move
  with one of the two dice. There are also very interesting rules about lane changes
  and spacing that I won''t get into, but the game is easy to learn and I expect it
  to be a lot of fun. Imperial  I thought this was going to be an automatic purchase
  for me but I decided to wait and see.  This is the next game from Eggertspiele that
  uses the same rondel mechanic for action selection, but I''ve heard that that is
  where the similarities with Antike end.  Interesting note: Matthias Catrein, our
  artist for Incan Gold, is also the artist for Imperial. BattleLore  The game wasn''t
  for sale but there were several demo copies at the Days of Wonder booth that saw
  heavy use.  It looks as nice as you would expect it to look and I''m sure it will
  be a great hit. On the Underground  Another game I would have liked to have tried,
  but when Erik, Jim, and KC decided to play early in the week it was just too late
  for me to learn a new game and still be fresh enough for the morning.  Matthias
  also did the art and graphical design for this game.  The obvious comparisons were
  to Ticket to Ride, but there''s enough different about the game to make it interesting. 
  Jeez, the map of the London Underground is enough to keep me interested!  I was
  also very impressed with the compact box for this game - this is a big board with
  nice bits all packed in a very small box. Hamelyn  Didn''t pre-order it, couldn''t
  buy it, didn''t play it. Green Town  This Bambus Spiel release had a lot of promise
  when I watched Rick Soued, his son Alex, and Ned Medinger from Funagain play it. 
  The game involves tile laying, structure building, and traveling along increasingly
  lengthier routes in the town based on an objective card each player holds. The problem
  is this - the game has a bad arc as it gets increasingly more difficult to plan
  moves as the game goes on, increasing downtime and analysis required for each player. 
  It just dragged on towards the end and didn''t have a satisfactory resolution. 
  There''s something good inside this game but I think it needed some more development.
  Fowl Play  The new Richard Breese design had favorable comments but I didn''t manage
  to learn much about the game. Die Baumeister von Arkadia  One of my top 2 games
  in Essen, I already wrote a more detailed description of the game earlier in the
  week.  Salamanca  The driest of the bunch I played in Essen, I also wrote about
  this game earlier in the week. Die Saulen die Erde (Pillers of the Earth)  While
  I didn''t see a full play of this game, I did watch Jim Ginn play for a turn and
  finished his game while he had to return to the booth to meet up with Ben.  This
  game does have quite a bit of German text on cards, but they are always open so
  it is easy to discuss translations and recognition will be easy based on pictures
  and key words.  The basic mechanics of the game work like this (I just might get
  some of this wrong so be kind):  Players allocate workers to a number of different
  resource areas (sand, wood, and stone) based on 7 of 9 different cards that are
  turned up each turn.  A player chooses a card then allocates the proper number of
  workers to that area and will harvest those resources later in the turn.  Extra
  workers can be used to earn gold.  Each player has three action tokens that get
  dropped in an opaque bag.  A player pulls out a token at a time - the player owning
  the first token drawn gets the choice of going first if and only if he is willing
  to pay 7 gold.  If he decides not to, his token goes on the seven marker on a semi-circle
  at the bottom portion of the board.  The next player token is drawn and and offer
  to go is made at 6 gold, and so on, until it gets to zero gold.  At this point,
  the player order is just in the order drawn.  This is a creative way to randomize
  selection order while still making players pay for the right.  When a player opts
  to place an action token, he places it in one of several regions on the board that
  will grant some benefit (a special card, protection from taxes, etc.).  These regions
  are then walked through in order where players take those actions.  It seems like
  the main way players earn victory points is by getting work cards that transform
  different resources into VPs. There are certainly some details and subtleties that
  I left out, but that''s the basic idea.  Yes there are some similarities to Caylus
  but this is different enough to warrant a try if you like that sort of game.  There
  should be a Mayfair release of this Kosmos title in early 2007.'
