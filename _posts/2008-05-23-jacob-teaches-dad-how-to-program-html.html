excerpt: Jacob is doing quite a bit more programming these days. In addition to some
  of his self-study of Ruby he is enrolled in a game programming class at Sherwood
  High School where he is refining his skills with GameMaker and learning how to write
  simple games using VB.Net. A few weeks back we were working on a small programming
  problems together - how to detect if a given string is a palindrome (i.e., reads
  the same both forwards and backwards). I start by walking Jacob through some simple
  string operations whereby you can walk through a string character by character forwards
  and backwards, then showing him how to loop and walk his way into the middle, testing
  for equivalence along the way. Jacob then says something to the effect of "Dad,
  why don't you just call reverse on the string and see if it is the same as the original."
  Oh. I guess that could work. If you were into that sort of elegance and time-saving.
  Whatever floats your boat I guess.
