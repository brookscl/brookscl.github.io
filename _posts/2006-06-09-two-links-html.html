excerpt: First, in case you didn’t know, fellow gamer Moritz Eggert’s soccer/football
  composition “Die Tiefe des Raums” will be performed at the opening ceremonies for
  World Cup 2006.  Moritz is of course most famous for his review of Havoc last year.
  Second, Stephen Cole of Star Fleet Universe just published his free book on Running
  a Game Publishing Company.  There’s some good stuff here, but I have yet to read
  it all the way through . Almost afraid to as I’ll be forced to face all of the mistakes
  we’ve made so far at Sunriver Games.  Maybe that will qualify us to help with the
  second edition of this book.
