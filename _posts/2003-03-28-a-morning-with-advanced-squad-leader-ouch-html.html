excerpt: Ken Rude and I spent a morning last Saturday with a local  gaming group that
  regularly plays Advanced Squad Leader and is open  to newbies interested in learning
  the game. I played Squad Leader,  along with the two expansions Cross of Iron and
  Crescendo of Doom, back in the  late 70s / early 80s when I was very into the Avalon
  Hill war games.  I  loved the scale of the game - squad level tactics, with counters
  representing  single leaders, tanks, or small squads of infantry.  It was (is) a
  complex  game, but it was clearly my favorite of the AH games. The morning was a
  disappointment though.  The hosts were very kind, and  one of the group members
  walked Ken and me through a simple scenario (infrantry  only, a few machine guns,
  basic rules).  There is a price you pay for the  realism of this game - rules complexity
  that almost demands you focus on this  game in absence of any others.  Ken crushed
  me (he was the Americans, I was  German) but we both walked away wishing we had
  spent the morning playing lighter  games. I think in the future if I want that level
  of realism in squad level tactics,  I'll let the computer manage the rules and just
  play Laser Squad  Nemesis.
