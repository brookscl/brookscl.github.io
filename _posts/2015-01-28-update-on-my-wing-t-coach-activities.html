<p>I've got a brief follow-up to my <a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2014/12/21/our-next-chapter">post last month on our next chapter</a>. Earlier this month I published my <a href="http://wingt-coach.com/wingt-book">first book on the Wing-T for youth football</a>. If you are interested in this sort of thing and want to see a preview you can get a <a href="http://wingt-coach.com/free-belly-series-playbook">free copy of my Wing-T Belly Series book</a>.</p>
<p>Last weekend I was in <a href="http://www.nationalwingtclinic.com">Pittsburgh attending the National Wing-T Clinic</a>. I met many of the legends of Wing-T coaching and it was a great experience.  Of course I also got to spend time with Jacob at CMU.</p>
<p>Next up for me will be running my first online web clinic for football coaches in early March.</p>
