excerpt: 'I mentioned last week that some parts were missing from my Axis & Allies:
  D-Day game.  Sent an email to Hasbro/Avalon Hill/WOTC and got this quick response:  Please
  accept our apology for your defective product. I have sent out the replacement part
  requested to the address you provided below. And the parts showed up 4 days later. 
  Nice.'
