<p>Julie and I were at West Point last weekend to join Matthew for Ring Weekend - where the class of 2019 gets their class rings. </p>
<p>Did you know the concept of class rings started at West Point?</p>
<p>Matthew and I ran in the Ring Run 5k on Saturday morning with about 500 cadets and family members. We took first place for father/cadet team!</p>
