excerpt: 'I''m back at Salishan this weekend - three trips in less than a month after
  not visiting for over two months! We had a great Thanksgiving weekend here with
  the grandparents. Julie and I spent Tuesday night before Thanksgiving in Newport
  using a free hotel night that was soon to expire. We had a nice dinner, a great
  run in the morning around the bay, and a nice walk through old town.  The weather
  was great on Wednesday so Jacob, Matthew, and David played 9 holes of golf in Agate
  Beach (Matthew won our game of Lone Wolf) and were treated to a beautiful sunset
  on the drive back to Salishan.  I also snapped a nice shot of the boys with grandpa.  One
  of the highlights of the weekend for me was a burrowing owl sighting on the main
  road of Salishan spit. The owl was very welcoming to me, allowing me to get within
  about 10 feet as I GI-crawled towards it.  We had some great gaming as well, including
  a game of 18AL that was David''s indoctrination to 18XX. He also managed to win
  by about $40. He wasn''t so fond of Agricola, which we played on Saturday morning
  before driving back to Sherwood. David wasn''t quite so fond of Agricola. It can
  be a brutal game for newcomers and he never quite got control of the engine. Maybe
  I''ll talk him into another play some day... '
