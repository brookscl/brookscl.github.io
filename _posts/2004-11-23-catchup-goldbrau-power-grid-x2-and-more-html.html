excerpt: I'm well overdue on a number of session reports, including recent playtesting
  reports for KC's games.  Hopefully this is part 1 of 3 posts I'll make tonight.
  On November 13 I had several folks over at my home for our second round of guided
  playtesting.  Afterwards people stayed around to play some more games. Mike Deans
  brought along his new copy of Goldbräu, the brewfest game where players try to maximize
  profits by supplying the most beer to the most patrons in the beer garden.  Fantastic
  theme and a nice looking game, but the game was ho-hum.         Mike, KC, Ken, and
  I try out Goldbräu After the fact we learned that we played a number of rules incorrectly,
  so I'm anxious to try the game again to see if there's more to it.  My biggest frustration
  was holding cards that I knew I would never be able to play.  The second biggest
  was the try-and-out-guess-your-opponents mechanic (think Hoity Toity).  I often
  ended up randomly choosing my action. The kids played upstairs most of the day,
  spending a lot of time on our computers playing multi-player shooters and strategy
  games.  They did take a break to set up a double HeroScape set for some 2 on 2 action.         Brandon,
  Jacob, Jenna, and Matthew in the middle of a HeroScape battle.         While I was
  playing Goldbräu, another group of seven played Bang!.  See if you can guess who
  the sheriff is. To close the evening out, KC, Rita, Ken, Julie, and I played Power
  Grid on the Germany map.  I also had a chance to play this at work the Friday before,
  so it was nice to play again so quickly while the game was fresh.         Fun with
  Power Grid. This game was very tight, with all of the players within striking distance
  throughout the game.  KC had enough of an edge throughout that most of us figured
  he'd win unless he made a mistake - he came away with the victory.  This is one
  my favorite games - I put it right up there with Wallenstein and Acquire among my
  favorites. One game was played last weekend on Saturday that just have to mention
  - O Zoo Le Mio. This is an absolutely fantastic game to introduce folks to these
  board games.  Matthew and I taught his friend Dayton how to play, and he immediately
  latched onto the theme and the mechanics made perfect sense.  I gave him plenty
  of time to look at and try and arrange the tiles up for auction so that he could
  decide what to bid on.  I put this game over Carcassonne, TransAmerica, and many
  others as a gateway game.         Dayton sporting his Beavers shirt (we were watching
  the civil war game while playing) as he and Matthew build up their zoos.
