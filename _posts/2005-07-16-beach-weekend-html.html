excerpt: After returning from my trip to Israel, and thanks to a rare lack of scheduled
  baseball games, we worked in a weekend out at the beach.  The weather was spectacular,
  giving us the opportunity to take a hike up at Drift Creek Falls and spend some
  time at the tidal pools below the Inn at Spanish Head.         Jacob, Julie, and
  Matthew on the beach. This is a great beach for agate collecting and searching tide
  pools for critters.  It usually best to go at very low tides.  Speaking of critters,
  there were a ton of sea stars, hermit crabs, sculpins, and anemones in the pools.         This
  was a particularly cool scene - drooping anemones clinging for their lives. I brought
  out a few games to try, including the new release Caribbean.  Jacob, Matthew and
  I gave it a try one of the mornings.         Mathew, Jacob, and I giving Caribbean
  a try. My reaction to the game was "eh", but Matthew and Jacob were pretty fond
  of it.  Players vie for control of a fleet of pirate ships trying to steal booty
  and deliver it to safe havens; you control a pirate by making the most substantial
  bribe of rum to a ship.  Each player starts each turn with same available set of
  cards and allocates each one (numbered from -1 to 5) to a particular pirate ship. 
  Obviously the higher number gives you a better chance of influence that ship.  The
  number played also determines the number of spaces that ship will be able to move. 
  This is where the -1 tile comes in - you can't win influence when you play a -1,
  but you subtract one from the movement for that ship.  Points are earned by picking
  up treasures and by delivering them to your own safe haven. I found the game a bit
  too chaotic and I've never been too wild about the try-and-outguess-everyone-else
  mechanic.  However, it played quickly (about 40 minutes) and was some good light
  fun, so I'll definitely play it again if the boys ask for it.
