<p>We did a different sort of hike yesterday, and interestingly it was a lot harder on my feet than any of our prior hikes. We had a blast and successfully used the new Max Pass system and never waited more than 25 minutes. Usually less than 15. We hadn’t been since 1991 -- nice to see a lot hasn’t changed but the new stuff was fun.</p>
