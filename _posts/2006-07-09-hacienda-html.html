excerpt: On Saturday morning, Julie, Matthew, and I left home at about 5am to drive
  to Camp Pioneer to get Jacob at summer camp (more on that in a future post).  We
  made it home by about 11:30am and after cleaning up and some rest and relaxation,
  I talked the boys into playing Hacienda with me. Unlike some other new games that
  I’ve played recently (most notably Thurn & Taxis), I had no clue going into the
  game what was going to lead to a good score and thus had a hard time formulating
  any sort of reasonable strategy.  It comes down to the economics are various choices
  on your turn.  How important is income?  How much should I focus on blocking other
  players from markets?  Is harvesting a worthwhile action?  I figured that connecting
  to many markets would be a good thing.  Jacob and Matthew both had the lead over
  me at the mid-way point in the game, but I felt good about my position as I expected
  to be able to connect to 6–8 markets.  One mistake I made was laying down a water
  tile to block Jacob that in the end just gave him more victory points.  I over-valued
  income… if the block had prevented him from reaching a market, then it may have
  been worthwhile.  As it was, I just prevented him from getting some additional herd
  income.  Jacob forced the game to end 1 turn before Matthew and I wanted (good play
  on his part), preventing me from reaching my 7th market and giving him the victory. 
  I beat Matthew by one point. Everyone enjoyed the game and the wide range of choices
  offered.  The rules and strategy are not trivial in this game – I would put it on
  the heavier scale for euro games.  We look forward to playing it again soon.
