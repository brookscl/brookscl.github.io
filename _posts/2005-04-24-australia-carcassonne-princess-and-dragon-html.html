excerpt: 'I was in the Phoenix area this week on business travel and managed to join
  some old friends in Tempe for an evening of gaming.  I last met these guys back
  in September of 2003 on a business trip. Scott Bailey was kind enough to host; this
  was especially convenient as his house was only about 8 miles from my hotel near
  the airport.  Jason Sato arrived seconds before I and shortly thereafter we broke
  out the basic Carcassonne game with the Princess and Dragon expansion.  This is
  a good choice to set up as folks arrive as it scales easily.  As it turned out,
  three more people showed up over the next 10 minutes: Matthew Frederick, Kirk Bauer,
  and Shawn Asmussen.          Jason, Kirk, Matthew, Shawn, and Scott join me in a
  game of Carcassonne: Princess and Dragon. I''m not a big fan of Carcassonne with
  more than 3 players: it is almost impossible to plan ahead and a bit too chaotic
  for my tastes.  Princess and Dragon makes it a bit more bearable, surprisingly enough
  because it increases the chaos in the game.  The meeple-eating-Dragon also can serve
  as a bit of an equalizer and gives players the opportunity to go after the leader,
  something that is more difficult in the base game where there is very little direct
  confrontation.  There are also some nice tactical plays to employee with the princess
  that can cause rapid changes of control in large cities.  I give this expansion
  a thumbs up, though I''m unlikely to purchase it as Carcassonne isn''t very popular
  at home.  I believe Matthew captured the victory with me a not-so-close second place. 
  No farmers in the fields for me sure didn''t help. Rather than try another game
  with six players, we opted to break into two groups of three.  Jason had brought
  along his newly purchased copy of Australia, and Matthew and I eagerly approved
  of this as a choice for the three of us.          Jason, Matthew, and I about midway
  through our playing of Australia. The theme in Australia is pretty nifty: players
  control a cadre of rangers (they look sort of like boy scouts) working on construction
  and conservation projects in Australia in 1920s.  The mechanics are a bit difficult
  to explain here, but the basic idea is you want to fly in and drop your rangers
  into regions where they will be able to complete projects.  There''s a majority
  element here as players share in the rewards from the projects based on the rangers
  they have adjacent to the area where the project is, with the player that causes
  the project to complete through an action getting an extra three points.  Rangers
  are placed by flying your airplane to a region (1 action) and playing a card that
  indicates a number of rangers that can be placed in that colored region.  Cards
  provide a mix of income and ranger placements (the fewer rangers you are allowed
  to place, the more income you will receive). We played with the advanced rules that
  incorporates a windmill and an additional mechanic for scoring points.  When placing
  rangers in a region adjacent to the current location of the windmill (it moves around
  based on certain value construction projects being revealed), you have the option
  of placing one or more rangers on the windmill scoring track.  Scoring on this track
  happens everytime a certain number of projects are completed.  The scoring value
  on the windmill bumps up each time it is moved.          The game board in Australia.
  I enjoyed this game more than I expected based on the lukewarm reviews that I''ve
  read, though this could just be another manifestation of Cooley''s Law as I won
  by a decent margin.  I would gladly play this one again and will consider adding
  it to my collection.'
