<blockquote>Last year our focus was on making the show BETTER, and I think we succeeded. This year, we want to continue that trend. We're asking for your help as we pursue our goal of covering the entire world of board games. We have a myriad of cool rewards, but we hope that your main goal in supporting this Kickstarter is to keep the Dice Tower going. We are dedicated to keeping our show free for download and viewing, and appreciate those who join us in that goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've been a listener of The Dice Tower podcast since it started (I <a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2005/07/24/reviewing-the-boardgame-podcasts-html/">even reviewed podcasts</a> way back when) and continue to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomvasel/the-dice-tower-2016-season-12">support the network</a>. You should too if you listen or watch!</p>
