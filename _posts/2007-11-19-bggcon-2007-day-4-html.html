excerpt: 'My primary gaming buddy at BGG.CON was nowhere to be found on Sunday as
  he had an early flight to Indy, so I had to fend for myself to get some final gaming
  in as the convention wound down.  I needed to catch the airport shuttle at about
  3:30pm or 4:00pm so had plenty of time to play, though the game library was to close
  at 1pm.  I slept in a bit more Sunday morning, waking at about 9:15am and taking
  time to pack and say goodbye to Greg.  I was back in the game room by 10:30am and
  finally found Race for the Galaxy in the game library. Tim, Carrie, and Mark (Hamzy)
  joined me in this Tom Lehman game of galactic conquest using mechanics that will
  be familiar to San Juan players.  San Juan is one of my favorite card games ever,
  so a game that takes the mechanics further and adds the possibility of expansions
  is sure to hit a sweet spot for me.    This game is very good and I found the human
  factors and iconography to be excellent.  We were at risk of playing the game incorrectly,
  but Aaron Fuegi once again came to the rescue and gave us some tips as we started
  the game and kept us on track.  I got some nice combos early that allowed me to
  accelerate my development of new technologies and got a nice engine going.  The
  game ends when a player gets twelve cards in play and it was easy for me to accelerate
  the ending and claim the victory with 26 points, Carrie finishing second with 20. 
  I''ll definitely be putting in an order for this game and I hope it does well enough
  to see some expansions released.  Next I pulled Thebes out of the library to try
  and squeeze in a game in about an hour with Tim and Carrie.  Tim had played the
  game, Carrie had not so we took some time to teach but still managed to finish the
  game in just under an hour.  We did play a shortened version of only 2 years instead
  of the prescribed 2.5 years with 3 players, but the game was fun nonetheless.  I
  discovered that we played the first game of this incorrectly early in the convention
  - the debris you pull out of the excavation bags goes back in the bag after your
  dig, which keeps the odds of finding good stuff decreasing throughout the game. 
  This gives a greater advantage to players that dig earlier, which I think is appropriate. 
  Tim crushed us with 62 points, Carrie had 43, and I had 42.  He had an extremely
  successful final dig that netted him about 18-20 points which made the difference.
  Next up was Foppen, one of my favorite trick taking card games designed by Friedeman
  Frisse, who was at the convention.  Nate Sandall joined Tim, Carrie and I and we
  had fun as always, though Carrie rightfully pointed out that it just isn''t as much
  fun without Rita playing with us.  Tim went from worst to first in the game and
  beat us with some clever play in the final hand.  My last game of the convention
  was a prototype by Rick Young (Europe Engulfed, FAB: Bulge) called Leaping Lemmings. 
  As you can surmise, this isn''t a heavy wargame but is a light American style chaotic
  racing game.  Each player has a set of lemmings he is trying to race through a canyon
  to leap off the cliff at the highest possible speed.  Michelle Z ran the game with
  Jeff (Oboewan) also playing, and Jeff and I tied for the win with 14 points each.    I
  don''t have much negative to say about the game other than the action cards in the
  game may be very unbalanced.  Still, this isn''t the kind of game I like to play
  (it felt a bit like Zombies to me) but if a chaotic racing game with a dose of take-that
  works for you, this will be worth looking at. Farewell BGG.CON - a had a fantastic
  time and I''ll post a summary report on the convention and games I played shortly.'
