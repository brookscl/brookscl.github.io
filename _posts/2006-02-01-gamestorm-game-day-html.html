excerpt: " After Jacob’s Game Maker class two Saturdays ago (January 21) we drove
  up to northwest Portland to attend the GameStorm game day.  I was pretty amazed
  at the number of people attending – I counted at least 30 people there by the time
  we left in the early evening.  There was quite a variety of gaming going on, including
  Caylus, World of Warcraft, Liberté, and Ticket to Ride. Eager to knock a game off
  my burndown list, I brought out Ark of the Covenant and snagged a few players to
  join me.  This is just another Carcassonne variant, but it combines several aspects
  of other expansions that I like.  Now I should have read the rules a bit more carefully
  ahead of time, because there are a few easy-to-miss scoring rules (scrolls in cities,
  oasis by the road) and you ALWAYS have to check how unfinished roads and cities
  are scored.  Nonetheless, this is a fun variant and we had fun moving the ark around. 
  Jacob one handily if I recall.  One of my main reasons for attending (I skipped
  a Roads and Boats session, after all) was to get in another play of one of KC’s
  classic prototypes, Isla Nova (aka New Eden 2 aka Edenborough).  Ken and Carey joined
  Jacob and I and it was as fun as I remember – definitely one of our short-list games
  to try out in an upcoming playtest day.  This is a tile-laying game and is quite
  abstract, but it is rooted in a colonization theme where different communities or
  tribes are establishing competing industries.  The game played in just about an
  hour and felt very rewarding.  Next, Jacob and I played a 2–player prototype of
  Carey Grayson’s new game 24/7.  This is a light abstract designed primarily for
  2 players and it involves laying down domino-shaped tiles on a 7x7 grid.  You score
  points when you lay a tile that creates a sequence of tiles (in any direction) that
  add up to 24, 7, form a sequence, create 3 or more of kind, etc.  The game was quite
  fun and had Jacob and I captivated – plenty of tension, easy to teach, and great
  potential.  I hope Carey can get this into mass production."
