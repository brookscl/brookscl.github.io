excerpt: 'Yes, I said last regular season game - we made the playoffs!  After an 0-3
  start, we won the next 5 games and qualified for the 4th and last playoff spot.
  This leads to a rematch against the team that beat us 8-0 in our 3rd game.  The
  kids have really pulled together and it is exciting to extend the season for at
  least one more week.  Here are some highlights from the last game against Centennial,
  a brutal contest that we won 8-0 (a safety plus a TD).  This was a defensive struggle
  that we thought would end 2-0.  Matthew managed to break away on an inside trap
  play and score a touchdown.  In the highlights you''ll see Matthew (#63) at middle
  linebacker on defense and fullback on offense.      '
