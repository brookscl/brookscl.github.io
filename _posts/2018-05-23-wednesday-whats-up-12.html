<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2523" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/05/Utah-small.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Julie and I listened to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2379926435?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Riders of the Purple Sage</a> while roaming around southern Utah, a perfect place to take in this classic. I used to own the entire Zane Grey collection (gift from my paternal grandfather) but never got into the books and eventually let them go. No regrets on that front, but I was surprised at the quality of writing.</li>
<li>You can’t tour southern Utah without seeing copies of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2379692396?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Desert Solitaire</a> in just about every visitor center bookstore. The irony of course is that Abbey would want these centers destroyed and the parks returned to a wilderness state. The book was quite good if a bit rambling at times. I loved the story of his rafting adventure down the Colorado just before the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam.</li>
<li>I listened to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2383476936?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">Leonardo da Vinci</a> biography. If Leonardo had only been a publisher / finisher he would have been credited for a great many more discoveries and inventions.</li>
<li>Julie and I wanted a long fiction book to listen to on our trip out to NY, so we re-listend to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2397087577?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">The Talisman</a> by Stephen King. My first and only read was probably about 35 years ago and I don’t think it holds up very well. It is part of King’s world-building for sure (it meshes in, eventually, with The Dark Tower series) but I think there are too many holes to be “believable fantasy.”</li>

<h2 id="whatimexploring">What I’m Exploring</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2522" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/05/Packwood-lake-trail-small.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/packwood-lake">Packwood Lake</a> – Julie and I met Jacob and Kaitlin half-way and hiked this nice 10 mile round-trip in the shadow of Mt Rainier. A good early season option - some trace of snow and a bit of mud, but in great shape and well trafficked.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/5/10/17338512/paul-simon-career-songs-life-biography-robert-hilburn">Paul Simon vs. the World</a> – I didn’t realize that he’s been so condemned for Graceland.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/tampa-bay-buccaneers/post/_/id/20389">Former Bucs center putting NFL in past by hitting road for epic 48-state journey</a> – Great story. I bet this guy will end up extremely successful (financially and emotionally) in the aftermath of his NFL career.</li>

<li>Julie and I taught <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/29054261">The Great Dalmuti</a> to our family host in Broomfield, CO. Always a hit with larger groups.</li>
