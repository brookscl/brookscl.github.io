excerpt: 'Like many others out there I’ve adopted a modified Getting Things Done (GTD)
  (or check out the 43 Folders getting started guide) approach to personal task and
  time management.  GTD (and its extensions) addresses a topic area that many other
  systems ignore – how to deal with the email problem, and I think that’s partly why
  it has seen such widespread adoption. To date my GTD system has been about as low-tech
  as you can get – a modified PigPogPDA / Moleskine planner.  I need a paper-based
  system for its portability, unobtrusiveness, and ability to use in customer environments. 
  I’m not a big fan of using laptops in client meetings, and as I’m often meeting
  with high level bank CIO/CTO types, a paper system is both effective and professional. 
  For a while I used the full-blown system described in the PigPog article, but now
  that I’m on my third Moleskine I’ve simplified the system quite a bit.  At the front
  of the notebook I list out “Projects” (high level tasks from which next actions
  are generated), “Waiting For” (stuff I’m expecting others to accomplish), and “Someday”
  (wishlist or long-term items).  The rest of the notebook looks like a diary / journal
  where I take meeting notes and indicate next actions.  A next action is indicated
  simply with a single line and a box on the left margin that I can eventually check
  off.  I use a single sticky tab to indicate where the oldest next action is, and
  the cloth page marker to indicate where my “collection” (i.e., where I write new
  notes and actions) page is. I’m generally pretty effecient at managing email.  I’m
  a big fan of Zero Email Bounce (ZEB) and work dilligently to keep my inboxes as
  close to empty as possible.  The operative word here is “close” – my level of tolerance
  in Outlook is generally not having to scroll to see the oldest email in Outlook. 
  Even with this model, I still found myself leaving items un-resolved for too long
  in my inbox.  Another challenge is the fact that I have two discrete inboxes – work
  and personal – where I have a wide range of on-going projects.  I also wasn’t very
  effective at managing “waiting for” and “someday” type tasks in my electronic inboxes. 
  I could go to the trouble of transcribing items from the electronic inboxes to my
  paper system, but that’s just too much work and I’m unlikely to stick with such
  a model. Last weekend I found myself staring at a Gmail inbox with about 30 emails
  in it, and about 20 of those requiring some action.  Right about the same time I
  noticed the release of a Firefox plugin for applying GTD to Gmail – GTDGmail.  GTDGmail
  is a greasemonkey-style mashup on GMail that combines some client-side cleverness
  with GMail’s powerful labeling and filtering mechanisms to deliver a comprehensive
  GTD inbox system.  It uses what I think is probably a little-known feature in GMail
  – you can send emails to username+label@gmail.com to have GMail automatically apply
  a label to an incoming message or to apply special filtering rules to the message. 
  This allows me, for example, to set up a special email address in my BlackBerry
  and easily email new tasks to myself.  As you can (sort of) see in the image below,
  GTDGMail also adds some UI accelerators to the interface to easily navigate to actions,
  waiting on, specific projects, etc.  For the past 4 days I’ve been able to keep
  my GMail inbox at zero emails and feel that I’m much more on top of all of my personal
  projects (Sunriver Games, football coaching, scouts, etc.).  There has been a ton
  of chatter lately about using Outlook (especially the beta Outlook 2007) for managing
  GTD.  I own the Getting Things Done Outlook Add-In, but was eager to abandon it
  as it added instability to Outlook and I found that the only feature I really used
  was the “snooze” capability (not a good habit to get into). Melissa Macbeth wrote
  the article Outlook 2007 and Getting Things Done, Simon Guest expanded on those
  concepts in his article Implementing Getting Things Done using Outlook 2007, Omar
  Shahine expanded on those concepts with an improved macro, and finally Scott Hanselman
  recently published a podcast on A Better Outlook, including GTD add-ons for Outlook.
  While I like Omar’s macro, it does even more than I need.  I don’t really need to
  track contexts or projects for my tasks – turning an email into an action and moving
  it out of my inbox is good enough.  So… I took his macro and changed it a bit:  Rather
  than turn the email into a true Outlook task, I prefer to keep it as a mail item
  but call “MarkAsTask” to force it to show up in the To-Do Bar.  Note that even though
  I use the enumeration olMarkLater, Outlook still wanted to make the task due “today”
  so I had to do a little hackery to get it right (see the comments in the code).
  I also want to move it out of my inbox into a sub-folder of the inbox.  This forces
  me to discover the folder by name, and I don’t think that’s a simple thing to do. 
  I found a sample function that will traverse down a series of / delimited folders
  and it seems to work – YMMV. I don’t throw up a dialog to allow me to set a category
  – as I said, I’m not tracking projects, so just adding the “Action” category is
  enough. I also turned on two rules:  If I email myself (I’m on the from: and to:
  line, and it is only sent to me), then I assume it is an action and I mark it and
  file it as such. If I email someone else and include myself on the CC: line, then
  I assume it is a “waiting for” and I mark it and file it as such.Public Sub CreateNextAction()     Dim
  olExp As Outlook.Explorer     Dim myolApp As Outlook.Application     Dim myNamespace
  As Outlook.NameSpace     Dim myTasks As Outlook.Folder     Dim myFolder As Outlook.Folder     Set
  myolApp = Outlook.CreateObject("Outlook.Application")     Set myolExp = myolApp.ActiveExplorer     Set
  myNamespace = myolApp.GetNamespace("MAPI")     ''Uncomment the next line if you
  prefer to move the email to tasks.     ''Set myTasks = myNamespace.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderTasks)          ''
  Otherwise, we''ll move it to a sub-folder under the inbox and keep it     '' as
  a regular mail item     Set myTasks = GetFolder("Mailbox - <your username here>InboxActions")              ''
  Check for the toolbar button.  I prefer to use X as the hot-key instead     '' of
  N.     Set myobjCB = myolExp.CommandBars.item("Standard")     On Error GoTo MyError     Set
  objNA = myobjCB.Controls("Ne&xt Action")     On Error Resume Next          Dim cntSelection
  As Integer     cntSelection = myolExp.Selection.Count          '' For each selected
  item, assign the "Action" category,     '' mark it as a task with no due date, and
  move it to the action     '' folder.  I don''t feel a need to organize tasks by
  project,     '' so I don''t bother to show a category dialog like Omar does.     For
  I = 1 To cntSelection         Dim item As MailItem         Set item = myolExp.Selection.item(1)         Set
  MyTask = item.Move(myTasks)         Subject = MyTask.Subject         Subject = Replace(Subject,
  "FW: ", "")         Subject = Replace(Subject, "fw: ", "")         Subject = Replace(Subject,
  "RE: ", "")         Subject = Replace(Subject, "Re: ", "")         MyTask.Categories
  = "Action"         MyTask.MarkAsTask (olMarkLater)         '' This next line is
  a hack to make sure it doesn''t get assigned a         '' due date.  Otherwise,
  olMarkLater sets the due date to tomorrow.         '' This is PROBABLY a bug in
  Outlook 2007.         MyTask.TaskDueDate = MyTask.TaskCompletedDate         MyTask.Subject
  = Subject         MyTask.Save     Next          Exit Sub MyError:         Set objNA
  = myobjCB.Controls.Add(msoControlButton)         objNA.Caption = "Ne&xt Action"         objNA.FaceId
  = 7264         objNA.Style = msoButtonIconAndCaption         objNA.OnAction = "CreateNextAction"         objNA.BeginGroup
  = True         objNA.TooltipText = "Create a Next Action task from this E-mail"
  End Sub   Public Function GetFolder(strFolderPath As String) As MAPIFolder   ''
  folder path needs to be something like   ''   "Public FoldersAll Public FoldersCompanySales"   Dim
  objApp As Outlook.Application   Dim objNS As Outlook.NameSpace   Dim colFolders
  As Outlook.Folders   Dim objFolder As Outlook.MAPIFolder   Dim arrFolders() As String   Dim
  I As Long   On Error Resume Next    strFolderPath = Replace(strFolderPath, "/",
  "")   arrFolders() = Split(strFolderPath, "")   Set objApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")   Set
  objNS = objApp.GetNamespace("MAPI")   Set objFolder = objNS.Folders.item(arrFolders(0))   If
  Not objFolder Is Nothing Then     For I = 1 To UBound(arrFolders)       Set colFolders
  = objFolder.Folders       Set objFolder = Nothing       Set objFolder = colFolders.item(arrFolders(I))       If
  objFolder Is Nothing Then         Exit For       End If     Next   End If    Set
  GetFolder = objFolder   Set colFolders = Nothing   Set objNS = Nothing   Set objApp
  = Nothing End Function  So far it is working pretty well.  I’ve got ZEB right now
  in Outlook and a clear handle on my actions, what I’m waiting for, etc.  The potential
  downside of this overall system is that I have three inboxes – my notebook, GMail,
  and Outlook.  If I’m sitting around with my BlackBerry and my notebook and an action
  comes to mind, do I write it down or email it to myself?  Should I periodically
  scan my notebook and just push items into Outlook or GMail?  I don’t know yet and
  will report back after a few months to let you know where I’ve landed.'
