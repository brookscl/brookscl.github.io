excerpt: 'Yes, I''m very lucky that my beautiful wife Julie is originally from Las
  Vegas and that her wonderful mother and step-father (Jan and David) still live there. 
  It clearly doesn''t suck heading there for Christmas about every other year.  It''s
  not like I''m a big gambler or anything, but I always love hitting the casinos once
  or twice to play some small-stake craps, Caribbean stud, or one the many other poker
  variants popping up in casinos these days. Last May the four of us spent a long
  weekend in Vegas, and Julie and I had a date together on the strip, staying at the
  Aladdin Hotel.  We were fortunate that trip to get upgraded to a wrap-around luxury
  suite and had a fabulous time.  It was so much fun that we spent another night on
  the strip, this time at Bally''s, while Jan and David watched Jacob and Matthew. 
  Win-win for everyone!  Bally''s is the old MGM Grand (yes, the one that had the
  fire back in 1980) and is in a great location near the Paris and the Bellagio. 
  We took a taxi down to Mandalay Bay to see Mama Mia! and had dinner at the Rumjungle. 
  The evening finished with a small amount of gambling (I played Caribbean Stud) and
  music in one of the Bally''s lounges.        View from our room at Bally''s.  You
  can see Paris, Aladdin, and New York New York. There were a lot of other highlights
  that week.  I''ll convey these with some more photos and commentary.        Jacob
  and Matthew with Grandma Jan and Pappa David before heading to dinner at the Las
  Vegas Country Club.         Jacob and Matthew with cousin Jacob.         Jacob and
  Matthew on Christmas morning with Uncle Mike.         Yes, that''s Jacob with a
  Python programming book.  That was the absolute-must-get-gift for him this year.         I
  rarely post photos of myself, but I thought this one with Julie looked pretty nice.         Matthew
  the psycho fireman.         Jan and David were nice enough to give us a Karaoke
  machine for Christmas.  Matthew and Kelsey entertained the crowd with this rousing
  rendition of Paperback Writer by the Beatles.         Jacob applying his newly discovered
  Python programming skills the day after Christmas.         We played a lot of street
  two-hand-touch football this year.  Julie''s brother Dave flew in on Friday and
  we got a chance to play two-on-two Saturday. '
