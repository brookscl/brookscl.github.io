excerpt: 'Jacob and I spent Saturday and Sunday up at Nanitch Lodge with our Boy Scout
  troop.  This is the sixth straight year I''ve been to a scout outing up on the mountain,
  but my first time spending the night in the lodge.  We shared the lodge with three
  other local troops and had a blast.  The weather was perfect (highs in the low 30s),
  we got a nice blanket of snow on Saturday, and the snow tubing was exciting as always
  (and no injuries!).  Here''s a great shot of Jacob getting some air.  Last night
  Julie and I walked over to Matthew''s school to see his big 4th grade play on the
  history of Oregon (My Oregon Report by Ralph Nelson).  Matthew played Thomas Jefferson
  - the guy who swindled Napoleon out of the Louisiana Purchase and set Lewis and
  Clark off on their way to Oregon.  Matthew did a great job acting and singing and
  we are very proud of him. '
