excerpt: " Jacob and I spent most of the weekend in Corvallis at the Oregon Destination
  Imagination state tournament (more on that later).  I brought along three of the
  new games I picked up last week at Boards & Bits that would be good with two players:
  San Juan, Dracula, and Blue Moon. We didn't arrive until about 7:30pm on Friday
  and had a quick dinner at a local Mexican restaurant.  Back in the room by about
  8:30pm so we decided to try out Dracula.         Jacob and I playing Dracula Friday
  night after our arrival in Corvallis. Dracula is a nice two-player small box game
  in the Kosmos / Rio Grande series.  Very much a gothic theme, with Dr. Van Helsing
  and Dracula duking it out on the streets of London. This is a memory game, combined
  with a bit of bluffing and card management.  We enjoyed the game - I think Matthew
  will like it quite a bit.         Close-up of the game.  The artwork and bits are
  first-rate. On Saturday while waiting for the awards ceremony in Gill Coliseum,
  Jacob and I played a shortened game of San Juan.  This is the card game based on
  the fantastic board game Puerto Rico, and I think it is a winner.  We played a shortened
  game (about 9 buildings built instead of 12) and Jacob won pretty easily.         Jacob
  playing San Juan in the bleachers at Gill Coliseum.  "
