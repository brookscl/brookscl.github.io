excerpt: "      Merry Christmas to all! The weather has turned for the worse today
  - high winds, rain, and so much fog we can barely see across the bay.  We've had
  a wonderful Christmas here so far and are presently huddled up watching Harry Potter
  and the Prisoner of Azkaban (one of several DVD gifts exchanged this year, the others
  being Return of the King extended version, Grease [widescreen edition], and of course
  Dodgeball). We may very well stay inside for the day, though a beach walk in this
  extreme weather might be a fun diversion.  Wherever you may be, best wishes to you
  and may the spirit of the holidays fill your life with joy."
