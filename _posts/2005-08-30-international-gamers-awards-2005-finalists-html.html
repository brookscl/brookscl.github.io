excerpt: " As announced on the GameWire, the finalists for 2005 are out. Nobody asked
  for my opinion, but here goes.  In the General Strategy category, I’ve played 6
  of the games.  I’ve observed Around the World in 80 Days and Louis XIV so have a
  decent idea about the play in each of those.  I know very little about Ubongo or
  Ys, but have heard great things about Reef Encounter. Of the games I have played,
  I would vote for Ticket to Ride – Europe or Shadows Over Camelot.  My opinion might
  change after I get a chance to play Reef Encounter.  Ticket to Ride – Europe improves
  substantially on what was already a solid game (better ticket distribution, tighter
  board, big cards), and Shadows Over Camelot is my family’s new favorite cooperative
  game (surpassing Lord of the Rings: the Boardgame).  I’m not a big fan of Keythedral,
  and I think Antiquity and Struggle of Empires might be a bit too big / long to win. 
  Carcassonne: the City is a great game but might suffer from excessive sequel-itis.
  I can’t say much about the two player category.  I own War of the Ring and Dungeon
  Twister but haven’t played either.  I gave Oceania as a gift to a friend but haven’t
  played it, though I understand the mechanics well – I suspect it is too thin to
  win.  Jambo, the only game in the category that I have played, is a very solid two
  player game that I would love to own. I bet it has a decent chance of winning."
