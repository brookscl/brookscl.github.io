excerpt: 'This has the potential to be very cool.  Fantasy Flight and Eagle Games
  seem to have have struck a resonant chord with their recent introductions of computer
  game (and novel) inspired board games.  The licensing costs must be very high, but
  clearly the economic model seems viable (I suspect they project based on Lord of
  the Rings Boardgame sales, which have been very high).  Fantasy Flight has also
  posted an article on the making of the game, which gives some insight into the gameplay.
  And, like Eagle Games, Fantasy Flight has been kind enough to post the rules to
  the game in advance of the release.  At first glance there appear to be some similarities
  to Age of Mythology, but also some key differences:   There is a physical, spatial
  layout in this game as opposed to the Puerto Rico style player boards in Age of
  Mythology.  As you would expect given the game board, there is movement.  Individual
  units can be upgraded.  Combat is more complex - looks like a traditional wargame
  in this respect.  In short, this looks like a light wargame with a very cool theme.'
