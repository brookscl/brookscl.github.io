excerpt: Erich and I arrived early Thursday morning at about 4am local time.  We weren't
  terribly well rested but got to the Hotel Sharon in short order and managed a couple
  of hours of sleep before our meetings were to begin at 8am.  Our hotel was completely
  booked for Friday night, meaning we would have to check out Friday morning and move
  to a new hotel in Tel Aviv for Friday evening, then return to Hasharon on Saturday. 
  This hotel is situated on some amazing Mediterranean coastline, but the amenities
  were somewhat utilitarian.  This is a theme throughout Israel - not much gloss with
  a focus on the pragmatic.         View from my second room at Hasharon.  That's
  the lifeguard station down on the beach. We spent a full day in prep meetings on
  Friday, finishing at 7pm.  I took a quick swim in the indoor pool then Erich and
  cabbed it over to the Marina in Herzliya for a nice meal in this shopping district. 
  Thursday evening is the start of the weekend in Israel, with Fri/Sat being the traditional
  days off.  We still had a lot of prep work to do so we worked through most of Friday
  with our partner, finishing about 4pm. Our partner was generous enough to provide
  a company car for us to use to get into Tel Aviv and then tour Jerusalem on Saturday. 
  We grabbed our luggage and took the 20 minute drive into the beach area in Tel Aviv
  to check in at the Sheraton Tel Aviv.  This is a very nice hotel situated right
  in the downtown beach area, and shortly after check-in Erich and I strolled down
  to the water.  I swam for about 15 minutes - the water was very nice and relatively
  calm thanks some rocks/reef to break the tide a ways offshore.         Erich and
  I strolled out on a jetty to watch several fisherman.  The tall building in the
  background is our hotel. That evening we enjoyed a meal at the Old Port Tel Aviv,
  a boardwalk area with some decent restaurants and immense nightclubs.  We aren't
  exactly the clubbing types, so we stuck to dinner and some ice cream afterwards
  and returned to our hotel to catch up on some sleep.  Saturday was spent in Jerusalem
  - more on that in my next post. Saturday evening through Tuesday were spent back
  in Herzliya.  The days were packed with meetings with our prospect and we were fairly
  exhausted by the end of each day.  We did manage to get out to the beach on Sunday
  after work.  The swimming wasn't as pleasant - there's a significant undertow that
  made me a bit uncomfortable (this is a popular surfing spot - there were always
  10-15 surfers offshore).         Erich and I enjoying a beer after taking a swim.
  Tuesday evening our flight departed Ben Gurion airport at about midnight.  We managed
  to get a bit of shopping in, and it was in the duty-free toy store that I had my
  first glimpse of games offered in Israel.  I had visited two shopping areas around
  Tel Aviv and failed to see anything resembling family strategy games.         Looks
  like Hebrew versions of TransAmerica and Chicken Cha Cha. As you can see, a limited
  selection.  But still, would you ever see TransAmerica in an American airport? 
  Doubtful...
