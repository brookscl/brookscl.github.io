> Posts are usually 1) a link as the post’s title, 2) an excerpt from said link, and 3) a snippet of commentary. Occasionally, a list post will turn into a mini-essay; other times, the commentary will be a single sentence. Think of it as a retweet with comment on a domain you control.

> As a reader, it’s a great UX—especially in an RSS reader. When you open the link in a browser, it opens to the actual link, not the link post. This also works with Instapaper—it saves the destination link, not the commentary. That said, there are many times where I get the gist of the link from the title and excerpt without having to click through. Come for the links, stay for the commentary.

> Unfortunately, most blogging platforms don’t natively support this format. There’s a post about linklogs running on Octopress, but the project hasn’t been updated since 2015 and it’s not the vanilla version of Jekyll that runs on GitHub Pages. I found another post from 2015 about DF-style linklogs on Jekyll, but it wasn’t 100% clear how to get this working with GitHub Pages without breaking the RSS feed. So I wrote my own implementation.2

I’ve adopted this convention with my Jekyll blog and have included in my automation. I can simply select the text I want to quote, and the Shortcut does the rest.
