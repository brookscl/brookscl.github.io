<p>I don’t write much here any more – too much time writing on other places on the Internet. I at least used to be frequent about travel writing here, but Julie does most of that now over on <a href="http://plan-pack-go.com/">Plan, Pack, Go</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wingt-coach.com/">Wing-T football</a> work is still fun and growing. It isn’t a supporting income by any stretch, but I love writing and talking about football so making some money helping other coaches is a nice small payoff. And I’m very excited to be coaching again this coming season: 8th grade with the <a href="http://www.lincolnyouthfootball.info/">Lincoln Youth Football</a> organization in Portland. Blending the nerdy and tech world, I’ve got over 70 coaches using <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> each week to collaborate on improving their Wing-T football coaching skills.</p>
<p>I’ve started another business, this one focused on technology leadership development. The site is named <a href="http://techleaderlevelup.com/">Tech Leader Level Up</a>, and is also where I’m hanging my shingle out for interim Chief Technology Officer / VP of Engineering work and related consulting. I’ll be writing articles over there frequently so if you are interested in that sort of thing, subscribe to the feed and consider <a href="http://techleaderlevelup.com/online-courses/">signing up for my newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>For now I’m delivering my technology leadership training in person (to two different companies so far), but my long-term goal is to feature it primarily as an online delivery. Julie and I don’t mind traveling on-site, but eventually the scale and time requirements will limit the amount of students I can reach.</p>
<p>On the interim leadership front, I’m a part-time CTO over at <a href="https://groupees.com/">Groupees</a>, an online marketplace for digital entertainment products run by a friend and former Corillian co-worker. It is a fairly simple site but with solid growth and a very loyal following.</p>
<p><em>Side note – <a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/now/">I have a Now page</a> (part of the <a href="http://nownownow.com">nownownow project</a>) where you can keep tabs of what I’m working on now. I updated it frequently.</em></p>
