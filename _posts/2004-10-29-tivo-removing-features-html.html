excerpt: Boy, this could be enough to push me back towards cable and Windows Media
  Center.  I don't know if they'll push this patch down to DirectTivo (which isn't
  officially a Tivo device, though of course DirecTV licenses their software from
  Tivo), but this would have a pretty big impact on us.  We commonly record pay-per-view
  shows and keep them for months (mostly because of Matthew).
