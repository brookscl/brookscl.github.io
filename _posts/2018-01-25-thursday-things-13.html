<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I’m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/the-age-of-age-of-empires-as-told-by-the-devs-who-built-it/">“The least-worst idea we had”—The creation of the Age of Empires empire</a> – Inspired me to get some similar RTS games installed on my iMac.</li>
<li><a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2018/how-to-fix-facebook-before-it-fixes-us/">How to Fix Facebook—Before It Fixes Us</a> – Worth a read. I think Facebook has serious problems ahead of it and will see dramatically declining engagement.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a15063971/breaking-bad-cast-interview/">‘It Had Never Been Done on Television Before’: The Oral History of Breaking Bad</a> – Read this and just try not to go back and reewatch the series.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenib.com/the-good-war">The Good War</a> – I’m guilty of being drawn into this particular fiction, but I think the comic is off in several areas. Still good to get different perspectives.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/01/22/matt-cutts-usds-interview/">An Interview with Matt Cutts: Can the Government grow a Money Mustache?</a> – Gives me just an ounce of hope that maybe some parts of our federal government are functioning well.</li>
<li><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-write-a-blog-post/">How to Write a Blog Post</a> – I don’t do this much editing, but you probably already know that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2272" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/01/ASL-1-small.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li>I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27002340">Defiant Russia</a> and <a href="/blog/2018/01/16/defiant-russia/">wrote a short article about it</a>.</li>
<li>I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27002823">Red7</a> with Julie and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27105288">Ken</a> – it has become a staple and works great even with two players.</li>
<li>Julie and I brought out <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27029493">Blokus</a> and of course she crushed me. Don’t get into a land war with Russian and don’t get into an abstract game with Julie.</li>
<li>I’m ramping up my ASL play – <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27028505">played Advanced Squad Leader on 2018–01–13</a>, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27028500">on 2018–01–13</a> and on <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27133840">2018–01–19</a></li>
<li>Julie and I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27061063">Rummikub</a> which is a staple for us. We even have two copies, just in case.</li>
<li>I finally played the solo game <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27089513">Friday</a> and enjoyed it. Will keep ramping up difficulty.</li>
<li>Ken and I also played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27125897">Star Realms</a>, and I should mention that my brother-in-law Dave and I have a continuous string of games going in iOS that has been quite fun and competitive.</li>
<li>Julie and I played the very obscure <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27134485">Plext</a> followed by <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27134928">Boggle</a>, two word games. I’m a bit of an ace at Boggle, and Julie beat me in Plext.</li>
<li>Sitting in a bar before a movie, Julie and I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27181886">Coin Age</a> twice and she beat me <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27181412">both times</a>.</li>
<li>I finally returned to my game group’s Tuesday night gaming and played a four hour slog of <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/27220328">Gloomhaven</a>. This is a very good legacy / RPG style dungeon crawl game that builds on the D&amp;D and Descent boardgames and adds improved campaigning and a very cool combat system.</li>

<h2 id="wherewearehiking">Where We are Hiking</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2271" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/01/Salmon-River-small.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theoutbound.com/oregon/hiking/hike-the-salmon-river-trail">Hike the Salmon River Trail</a> – This was an average hike but the weather was perfect and it was nice to get out for a while.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I read most of <a href="http://amzn.to/2FivKJS">Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers</a> and thought was OK. I’ve listened to many of the podcasts so there was redundancy, but it is nice to have a summary.</li>
<li>I listened to the epically long <a href="http://amzn.to/2DNYE7j">Hitler: Ascent 1889–1939</a> and it was… well, epic. Best bio I’ve read so far and the research and detail is unsurpassed.</li>
</ul>
