<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/personaltech/tech-security-experts-use.html">Bill Mckinley and Runa Sandvik</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is your biggest tip for people for protecting their online security and privacy?</p>
<p>The best things you can do are to use a password manager, set up two-factor authentication on the sites that offer it and keep all software up to date. Doing so helps secure access to your online accounts and limits your exposure to phishing and malware.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some good advice for most of us here. I use Signal but prefer Telegram which also supports end-to-end encryption.</p>
