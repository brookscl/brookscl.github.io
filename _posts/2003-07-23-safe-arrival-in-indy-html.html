excerpt: "                           Julie, Jacob, Matthew, and I arrived safely in
  Indianapolis tonight.              We had a great dinner at my sister’s place on
  the northeast side.  Julie             stayed there so that she can head up to West
  Lafayette tomorrow to see her grandmother,             and I took the boys down
  to Shelbyville to stay at my parents’ place.  Jacob             and I will drive
  downtown and try to arrive around 8:30 or so to pick up our GenCon             registration
  and get our bearings.  Our schedule tomorrow is:                  <![if !supportLists]>
  \            ·         <![endif]>10am             – noon – Seafarers             of
  Catan                  <![if !supportLists]>             ·         <![endif]>12:30pm
  \            – 2:30pm – Puerto             Rico                  <![if !supportLists]>
  \            ·         <![endif]>2:30pm             – 5pm – Free time for exhibit
  hall and dinner                  <![if !supportLists]>             ·         <![endif]>5pm
  \            – 7pm – Tigris             and Euphrates                  <![if !supportLists]>
  \            ·         <![endif]>7pm             – 9pm - Samurai                               Not
  sure if we’ll stay that late – really depends upon             how Jacob is doing.
   Don’t know if there will be connectivity at the show             – if there is,
  expect some mid-day updates.  Otherwise I’ll post             a report tomorrow
  evening (my parents have broadband wifi – how cool!).               "
