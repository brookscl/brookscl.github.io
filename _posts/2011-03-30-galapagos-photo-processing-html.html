<p>The really enjoyable part of Galapagos and taking photos is over.  Now I'm faced with the daunting task of processing these photos:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/03/20110330-1faita9kfh6upht4y2ty4s8era.jpg" alt="Lightroom" /></p>
<p>That's about 120GB total of mostly Canon 7D raw photos (usually about 20MB each) plus some stills and videos from my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 point-and-shoot.  This isn't <em>that</em> unusual for me - I sometimes shoot 30GB of photos on a single night of a football game.  Still, there's complexity here as I want to find the "best of show" shots of particular animals while retaining enough of a time series to capture the flow of the overall trip.</p>
<p>My workflow involves aggressively deleting photos that are non-keepers. I'll go through each day's photos in Adobe Lightroom and use single-key shortcuts to mark photos as keep or purge.  This first pass is meant to discard photos that shouldn't be kept regardless of my later editing - poor exposure, blurry, etc.  Sometimes I'll shoot off a series of photos of a bird in flight and there's an obvious keeper out of multiple shots - no need to keep the 12 inferior ones.  Note that purging at this stage means forever deletion - I don't keep these photos around.  I'll probably prune from 6000-ish to about 200-300 or so.</p>
<p>After this pass I'll do another round of review involving rating photos (usually 3, 4, or 5 stars).  From there I can purge the lower-rated photos and start to arrive at a solid set for editing and publishing.  At this state purging doesn't mean forever deletion.  I just take them out of my working group for the trip.</p>
<p>Next I'll do group and individual photo editing.  We will likely do a photo book and video from the keepers, and there will be a few that I'll want to process even more for wall hanging.  Here I might bring Photoshop and some other tools like Topaz Adjust to play to produce the highest quality output I can.</p>
