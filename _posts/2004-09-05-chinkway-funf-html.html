excerpt: Got my latest issue of Counter magazine last week, and there was a nice article by
  Derek Carver about a trick taking card game he designed.  What made the article
  interesting was the narrative about how the game has evolved (primarily due to publisher
  guidance and pressure).  The game started as FÜNF, then became Chinkway (a play
  on the Italian Cinque), and now is published by daVinci as Farfalia.  The rules
  look very interesting and should be worth a play - you can find the rules for the
  5-player-only game Chinkway at Pagat.
