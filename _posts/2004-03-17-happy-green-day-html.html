excerpt: Been a while since I posted some family photos, so here are a few I thought
  were more than worthy.        Matthew with a traditional Irish dinner of corned
  beef, green beans, green noodles, green artichokes, and green milk. Last Sunday
  I ran the annual Pack 710 pinewood derby.  I once again demonstrated my mechanical
  proficiency, doing my best to help ensure that Jacob and Matthew's cars barely made
  it past the finish line.  I really need to hire some outside consultants next year.        Jacob
  looking sharp in his Cub Scout uniform.  He lost a tooth at the pinewood derby!
