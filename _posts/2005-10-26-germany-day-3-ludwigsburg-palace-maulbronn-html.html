excerpt: 'Day 3 begin with our departure from Tubingen and a drive back north toward
  Heidelberg.  We planned for two stops along the way – Ludwigsburg Palace and the
  monastery at Maulbronn. After some small challenges parking (we started by trying
  to drive straight through the palace gate, but the guard would have none of that
  and sent us over to park below the department store) we entered the palace grounds
  by about 10:30am.  Note that this is a palace, not a castle.  Think estate, mansion,
  playground with the mistress.  The grounds were huge, and we only sampled a small
  part of it.  The best comparison I can think of is Versailles, but not quite as
  baroque.   (Note: that’s not our rental car in the picture above) We took the English
  tour which was well worthwhile, and really the only way to see the interesting parts
  inside the palace.  The guide was German-speaking but French, and her English was
  more than adequate for the tour.  The back story is the most interesting part of
  the tour.  We of course had to check out the game section of the department store;
  while not quite as impressive as the game store I saw in Frankfurt earlier this
  year, it still went way beyond what you see anywhere in America but the niche hobby
  game stores.     Next up was the drive to Maulbronn on the way to Heidelberg.   Julie
  and I greatly enjoyed the visit to the cloister; the boys were less impressed. 
  I think Julie and I preferred the more subdued architectural lines and stark nature
  of the monastery, while the boys prefer the gaudiness of the palace.   The name
  Maulbronn actually means “mule fountain”, and the town is famous for the legend
  of its founding:  Where the Eselsbrunnen ("mule fountain") stands today is where
  the mule was reputed to have stopped and quenched its thirst at a stream. The monks
  saw this as a sign from God and it was there that they decided to build the monastery.
  To this very day, the legend lives on in the name of the town (Maulbronn literally
  meaning "mule fountain"), the coat of arms of the town and the etching of the mule
  drinking from the water in the arched vault of the fountain house.    We finished
  the day with the drive to Heidelberg, which will be the subject of my next post.'
