excerpt: 'With Jacob snowshoeing / backpacking up on Mt Hood, and Julie/Matthew driving
  halfway to the coast to transport a friend, I rang up Ken to see if he was up for
  some 2-player gaming.  He was open to just about anything so I setup Combat Commander:
  Europe, scenario 5.  This is the "saving Castle Wolfenstein" scenario or something
  similar - the Germans are defending a chateau in Belgium and the Americans are storming
  the castle.  Not unlike scenario 2 that Jacob and I played recently.  I like "unbalanced"
  scenarios like this more than the 1st scenario where both sides are on a generic
  recon mission.  Of course they aren''t really unbalanced because of the initial
  conditions - in fact, I''m finding the scenarios so far to be incredibly well balance. 
  Either luck, coincidence, or they did a fair amount of scenario playtesting.  This
  was a marathon game, lasting nearly 5 hours with very little teaching and downtime
  involved.  I used a selective disclosure method of teaching the game which works
  quite well when you have an accommodating partner.  Ken and I are similar in that
  we both prefer not to grok the whole game at the start and just get into it.  We
  didn''t bother discussing artillery or ordinance until we got cards that forced
  me to teach him. The game play was incredibly tense - the best I''ve experienced
  so far.  I spent all of the game in the 22-27 VP range until Ken took over the chateau
  (worth at least 15 points), which gave me a very slight 3-4 point margin.  The problem
  was I was fast approaching my casualty surrender limit.  My other problem was that
  I had a secret 3VP objective of, you guessed it, the very same chateau which made
  my margin even slimmer. We managed to trigger two separate sudden death trigger
  tests, but neither one played out to my favor.  So it became a waiting game to see
  if another time trigger would happen or if Ken would draw an advance card to wipe
  out my surrender unit.  Well, it didn''t and he did, so game over.  I''m glad Ken''s
  first try at this game was so involved and rewarding - I suspect he''ll want to
  come back for more.   Prediction: CC:E and CC:A are going to be my two most played
  games in 2007.'
