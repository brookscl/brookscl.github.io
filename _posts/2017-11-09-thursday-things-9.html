<p>Skipped a few weeks so there’s a bit more than usual this time.</p>
<h2 id="whatandwhereimdrinking">What and Where I’m Drinking</h2>
<p>Overall I’m not drinking much at all - 1 or 2 nights a week at the most, and I feel better for it. I’m two weeks into an intense weight training program and trying to reduce my body fat percentage from about 15% to 8%. Wish me luck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried the beers Flower In the Kettle and Oathbreaker at <a href="https://www.wayfinder.beer">Wayfinder Beer</a>, one of my new favorite spots in downtown Portland. Close to Guardian Games and a solid menu.</li>
<li>Tried the beer Altbier at Verde Cocina Café, with beer being the highlight (16 oz can!). Food was bland.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Matthew was home for about 32 hours total and Julie and I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/25573619">Small World</a> with him. Big hit and fit into about a 2 hour window.</li>
<li>We also played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/25574647">Ninety-Nine</a> while at the aforementioned Wayfinder Bar.</li>
<li>Julie and I dropped by our friend Chuck’s game night to play <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/25622035">Honshu</a>. Lite, city building fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Via audio I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2hXQkG8">D-Day: The Battle for Normandy</a> my favorite-so-far telling of this story.</li>
<li>Found some good stuff in <a href="http://amzn.to/2zw53Se">The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age</a>, particularly the concept of a <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/06/tours-of-duty-the-new-employer-employee-compact">tour of duty</a>.</li>
<li>I suspect Ray Dalio, author of <a href="http://amzn.to/2zJJ777">Principles</a>, is a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-bridgewater-jensen/bridgewater-paid-off-employee-after-relationship-with-top-executive-wsj-idUSKBN1D72DO">major asshole</a> but there’s no doubt he gets results. There are some tough-to-stomach lessons in this book regarding self evaluation and truth and it is worth the read.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimwatching">What I’m Watching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Julie and I watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80067522">First they killed my father</a> on Netflix. We both read the book and wanted to see this. Worth it.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the third movie in Oliver Stone’s Vietnam trilogy <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107096/">Heaven and Earth</a> was a waste of time. Book was OK, movie awful.</li>
<li>We went to a free preview of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1653665/">Goodbye Christopher Robin</a> and enjoyed it.</li>
<li>Right now we are working our way through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/">The Man in the High Castle</a> on Amazon. I like how they take their time revealing what the true nature of this alternate reality is. Fun show.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2017/10/jazz-friday-joey-alexanders-joey-monk-live">Jazz Friday: Joey Alexander’s Joey. Monk. Live!</a> – This is the sort of stuff I listen to when I’m writing.</li>
