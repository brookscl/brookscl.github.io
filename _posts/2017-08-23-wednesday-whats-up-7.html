<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I listened to about half of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Six-Armies-Normandy-Liberation-Revised/dp/0140235426">Six Armies in Normandy: From D-Day to the Liberation of Paris; June 6 - Aug. 5, 1944</a>. I just don’t enjoy the pure historical recollection books as I do historical stories (fiction and non-fiction). I’m getting better at just moving on when something doesn’t engage me.</li>
<li>Likewise, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Days-Updated-Expanded-Strategies-ebook/dp/B00B6U63ZE/">The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded: Critical Success Strategies for New Leaders at All Levels</a> looks to be a good book worth reading, but audio is not a great format. At least not without diligence in note taking and capturing some of the guidance. I might pick it up to use as a reference for my coaching and training.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<p>Lots of gaming in the past week!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/24695072">I played Vietnam 1965–1975 with Allen</a> and I think we got through the intro scenario with most of it played correctly. This game is good enough to keep exploring, maybe culminating in a full campaign game before too long.</li>
<li>I played some lighter games like <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/24716065">Liar’s Dice </a>, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/24746249">Jump Drive</a>, and <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/play/details/24717369">Eye to Eye</a>.</li>
<li>I taught two new players how to play <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/24752537">Pax Renaissance</a> and we even started a second game. This game is not for everyone but I’m enjoying exploring it. And reading the card flavor text.</li>
<li>My weekly <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/24774486">Advanced Squad Leader</a> playing continued this week with another run at tanks and guns and infantry with the <a href="http://www.aslscenarioarchive.com/scenario.php?id=60394">Meat Grinder</a> scenario.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimlisteningto">What I’m Listening To</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/27/538397125/first-listen-tyler-childers-purgatory">First Listen: Tyler Childers, ‘Purgatory’</a> – This is available on Amazon Music Unlimited and is quite good.</li>
</ul>
