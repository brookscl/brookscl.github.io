excerpt: 'Took the family to Seattle for Thanksgiving weekend - it is a tradition
  for us to explore some area or just go somewhere for this holiday since all of our
  family is out of driving distance. This year we trusted in Amtrak to get us to Seattle. 
  We did this 4 years ago (compliments of Corillian for some hard work for a new big
  bank we had just signed) and thought it was time to give it another try.  I''ll
  post some more photos upon return, but here are some pictures of the gaming we''ve
  done this weekend.  We played a few games on the train ride up from Portland - the
  Cascades is a great train ride, about 3.5 hours so not much longer than a drive
  and much more relaxing.  We managed to play Settlers of Catan: Travel Edition, the
  Monopoly card game, and a bit of checkers.  Back in the room, Matthew, Jacob and
  I had a great game of Wyatt Earp.  Jacob and I have played about 3 games of Chrononauts
  so far - he keeps requesting to play this Looney Labs game.        '
