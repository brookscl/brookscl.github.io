excerpt: 'This will be another brief post - having a blast and don''t want to miss
  out on any gaming! I continued to play new games to me that were very good, including
  a few older releases.  Thebes has been on my play and maybe buy list for a while
  ever since the new Queen games production was released.  Doug and Mimi brought the
  original version out to Salishan last year but I wasn''t interested - maybe the
  bits weren''t nice enough?  A shame as the game is quite good, and as Greg said
  to me - the mechanics marry the theme perfectly.  Each player is an archaeologists
  gathering knowledge to conduct excavations in ancient sites (Thebes, Greece, Palestine,
  etc.).  Excavations are random draws from a bag - possibly too random for some people,
  but it was very fun and a quick play. This is one of the few new games for me so
  far that will go on my buy list.  Jim and I then played a quick 2 player game of
  Fjords.  This is a very fun game that reminded us both of Through the Desert.  I''m
  not sure I''ll ever buy it, but will gladly play the game any time.  I ran a demo
  session of Carey''s new design Bridgetown Races and it went well.  Yehuda was very
  favorable on the game, and all of the comments were positive.  I also got some good
  advice on possible mechanic and graphic design changes that could improve the game.  The
  big game of the day was Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.  Jim and I taught ourselves
  how to play the game and played a nail-biter all the way down to the last card plays
  of the last turn.  It was a 6.5 hour marathon that we played at an easy, learning
  pace but it was all good - we had no regrets taking so much time and it was a well
  contested battle.  We each made very rookie mistakes but they must have balanced
  out perfectly as we went into the last 2 turns essentially even.  Jim was able to
  lock up most of my troops in Africa which gave him the clear edge but it was still
  a nice chess game at the end.  We also had some nice help from Aaron Fuegi (former
  WBC champ) that clarified some of the rules and showed us how poorly we were using
  our Generals.  The evening ended about 2am with a game of Colosseum, the latest
  Days of Wonder release.  This is a surprisingly big, heavy game that was good (better
  than I heard from reading other reviews), but that I doubt I would play much.  There''s
  a lot to process and plan for as you work to put on your shows - it made my brain
  hurt, especially given how late we played it.  Still, Jeff and Jim really enjoyed
  it. '
