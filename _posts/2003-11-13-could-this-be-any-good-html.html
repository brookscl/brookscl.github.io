excerpt: " Front Porch Classics is (has?) released a “classic Coffee Table Game” for
  the whole family: Master & Commander, The Far Side of the World.  I'm a huge fan
  of the series of books by Patrick O'Brian, and can't wait to see the new movie starring
  Russell Crowe.  I read here that only 3,000 are being produced, and that the sticker
  price is $90.  Ouch. "
