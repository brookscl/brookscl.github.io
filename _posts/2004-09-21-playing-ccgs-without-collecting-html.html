excerpt: 'Many folks into German- or European- or Family Strategy Games or whatever
  you call them these days played collectible card games in the 90s, especially the
  original classic Magic: the Gathering and other critical favorites like Legend of
  the Five Rings, Middle Earth: the Wizards, Doomtown, and my favorite 7th Sea.   I''m
  mostly disillusioned by the CCG market for the same reasons many others are: the
  tendency to buy way too many cards, get the latest expansion, get ahold of more
  rares to be competitive, and a lack of time for the “metagame”: deck construction.
  Most of the CCG playing I''ve done in the past 5 years has been with starter decks
  or, preferably, pre-constructed theme decks.  This has mostly been with in print
  CCGs like Lord of the Rings, Magic, and A Game of Thrones CCG.  These games have
  great underlying systems and shouldn''t be ignored just because of the collectible
  element.  Well, Lord of the Rings isn''t such a great system, but you get my point.
  The out-of-print games should not be ignored.  I''ve picked up quite a few 7th Sea
  cards on eBay for a song, and last night I found a cool deal on a set of Middle
  Earth: the Wizards challenge decks.  I bought a decent amount of METW when it first
  came out in 1995, but couldn''t find folks to play (everyone was playing Magic). 
  I think these challenge decks could be a great way to give it another try for about
  the same price as a typical board game. What other OOP CCGs are worth trying?'
