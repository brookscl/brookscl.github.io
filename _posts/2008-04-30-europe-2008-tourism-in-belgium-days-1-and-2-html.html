excerpt: 'I''m going to break my Belgium report into two sections - tourism and Bulge
  military sites. This is the tourism section! Our day started very early with a walk
  from our hotel in Bloomsbury to the St Pancras Eurostar station about 5 blocks away.
  I purchased the tickets for the six of us back in December and checking in was a
  breeze at the automated machine. After some breakfast we boarded the train and were
  on our way to Belgium.  Julie and Matthew kept themselves busy on the train with
  a few games of Solo Dice.  Our Eurostar ticket was good for a transfer in Brussels
  to any other Belgium station on a standard intra-Belgium train. Our next stop was
  Liege to pick up our rental car. We had to wait about 2 hours at the Brussels Midi
  train station before the transfer, giving me time to get some Euros at the ATM (long
  line - only one ATM in the station!). This was the same station where I took a train
  to Amsterdam two years ago.  I was a bit nervous coming to Liege:    It was Easter
  Sunday and I knew that many of the rental car stations in the country were closed
  for the holiday. I had a reservation and was assured online that the station would
  be open, but still...    Julie and I had to cab it across town to get the car, then
  come back to the train station and pick up the rest of the crew  Turns out I had
  nothing to worry about - the office was open (clearly just for us - I''m certain
  they were shutting down as soon as we arrived). Unfortunately their one and only
  nav system was stolen so were going to have to navigate the old fashioned way with
  a map and navigator. The hardest nav we had was getting back to the train station
  from the rental office.  We made our way down the German border then cut across
  to our destination in La Roche en Ardennes. You''ll learn more about the drive down
  when I go into depth on our historical Battle of the Bulge site visits. Our hotel
  in La Roche was Le Luxembourg, a quaint hotel / B&B with a fabulous staff. Dinner
  at the hotel is mandatory on weekends and holidays so we were obliged to join the
  chef (also the owner) in the dining room. No complaints - the five course meal was
  fabulous and it was relaxing to just hang out in the hotel after a long day of traveling.
  Jacob was clearly recovering by dinner time, enjoying his broccoli soup and showing
  some better spirits.  Our first stop on Monday morning were the Grottes de Hotton,
  a spectacular cave system with a fine tourism center and guide service. Our tour
  guide was able to simultaneously conduct the tour in Dutch, French, and English.  The
  snow was falling steadily by the time we entered the caves, making this a nice retreat
  from some blustery weather outside. I was very impressed by how deep and extensive
  the caverns were - not on par with Mammoth or Carlsbad caverns, but dramatic nonetheless.  From
  Hotton we turned south to explore Luxembourg, getting a great tip in Diekirch to
  visit the castle in Vianden. We had only planned to visit Clervaux but this was
  a fortunate turn as Vianden was by far the better choice. The castle sits dramatically
  perched over the city and valley and offered amazing views from below and above.   We
  made a brief stop in Clervaux to admire the town and castle there, but there wasn''t
  much to see. It would be worth a visit in the future to see the photography exhibit
  there, but for those thinking of visiting the area you can stick to Vianden for
  your castle experience.  We ended our day with a light dinner at the Viking, the
  restaurant next door to our hotel owned by the same family. The food selection was
  limited, but the beer selection superb.  Dave and I both agreed on our new favorite
  beer - Rochefort 10. Fortunately it is available here in Portland at Whole Foods,
  but cost is a daunting $6-$7 per bottle. A nice luxury to have from time to time.  Speaking
  of our host, here''s a shot of the proprietor and chef from La Roche en Ardennes.
  I think he likes to come over to the Viking to party after he finishes serving his
  dinner guests at the hotel. '
