excerpt: I spent most of Saturday attending a very inspirational working session at
  Washington State University - Vancouver. The working group is the Northwest Distributed
  Computer Science Department (NW-DSCD) that is actively building out curriculum modules
  and strategies in support of the NSF CPATH (acro?) program. My involvement is aimed
  at collaborating with this group in their K-12 outreach efforts. The core goal of
  this working group is to introduce curriculum modules that support computational
  thinking for multi-disciplinary studies. This is aligned with my recent thinking
  about how to bring computer science (back?) into the high school classroom - a vocational
  approach (i.e., one targeted exclusively at those students that have already decided
  that studying computer science or related information technology) is destined to
  be a niche and outlier strategy. There is a place for AP-style computer classes
  that go deep into programming and that focus on programming for programming sake,
  but I'm convinced there's an opportunity to weave elements of computer science,
  computational theory, algorithms, etc. with other core courses. Obvious examples
  include discrete mathematics (e.g., graph theory, recursive algorithms), probability
  and statistics, and physics. Less obvious examples are digital media (art, music
  production) and English (linguistics). This summer TechStart is expanding its summer
  teacher professional development program (SuperQuest) by partnering with a national
  initiative called CS4HS (Computer Science For High School Teachers). We are bringing
  a variety of academic and industry professionals together to introduce opportunities
  for computer science integration for non-CS teachers and motivate current CS teachers.
  There will be workshops on CS Unplugged, Programming with Alice, Integrating Science
  and Technology with Vernier Instruments. There will be academic research presentations
  to excite teachers about the potential "gee whiz" side of CS, and there will be
  a panel focused on gender equity issues in CS. I'm also aggressively seeking funding
  to support curriculum development for a high school discrete mathematics class that
  incorporates some basic programming and computing. The idea is to design a math
  class (that meets the soon-to-be-finalized Oregon state discrete math standards)
  with plug-in modules that includes some CS Unplugged (perhaps a cryptography or
  minimal spanning tree model) and some introductory programming to explore or reinforce
  curriculum elements. Jacob and I are currently reviewing what looks to be a very
  solid discrete math / Python book called Mathematics for the Digital Age and Programming
  in Python that could be a robust foundation for this course.
