excerpt: Julie's mom Jan was in town for most of the week, which is spring break for
  the kids.  Papa David also arrived in town today, and Jan/David headed for the coast
  for an overnight stay.  Tomorrow morning I head to Malaysia and China for about
  a week for some business travel.  I'm taking the new camera with me so needed to
  empty the pictures off the memory card.  Here are some of the results!        Matthew
  teaches grandma Jan how to play Balloon Cup.        One of Matthew's favorite pastimes
  - lounging on the recliner while watching a soap opera. I recently picked up a copy
  of Union Pacific from my friend KC - a remake of the great game Airlines that I
  was able to play about a year ago with Doug and Mimi.  We are all very fond of these
  stock acquisition games (very reminiscent of Acquire), so this was a winner.  Jacob
  gives it a 9, Matthew an 8.        Jacob and Matthew learning Union Pacific.
