excerpt: You'll notice that I've made some small changes to the look and feel of the
  site.  That's because I've moved over to DasBlog by Clemens Vasters.  From a display
  perspective, there isn't much change (in fact, he based the design on the BlogX
  engine that I previously used).  What was sorely lacking in BlogX was a solid web-based
  interface for posting and managing images.  DasBlog fixes all that and didn't require
  that I change the core XML content files.
