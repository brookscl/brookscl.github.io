excerpt: 'Three years ago I purchased my first Apple computer, a MacBook Pro. This
  computer is still my primary work computer and is holding up very well. I’ve had
  to replace the hard drive and battery under AppleCare, and upgraded to 3GB RAM about
  18 months ago. At home I have an iMac that I purchased about 2 years ago. It has
  an attached Drobo with nearly 3 TB capacity that holds music, video, and photography
  media content. I’m still very happy living in a Mac world and thought I’d share
  the tools that have stuck around and become part of my everyday workflow. Media    Lightroom
  3 - This is my workhorse for photography workflow and image editing. 98% of the
  photo work that I do is in this tool, and with the improved integration with Photoshop
  for HDR and pano processing even the times I go into Photoshop feel like I’m using
  an extension of Lightroom. I use several of Jeffrey Friedl’s plugins but find most
  of what I need built directly into the product.    Photoshop CS5 - Julie has been
  the heavier user of Photoshop over the past 6 months, mostly to do design and layout
  work for school fundraising projects. The improved HDR and panorama processing tools
  have made several plugins I’ve purchased in the past obsolete.    iMovie - This
  remains my mainstay for video processing though I’m getting ready to kick it to
  the curb. My main issue is performance and range of video format support. Most of
  my iMovie work is for football scouting and I tend to get video from a range of
  cameras. I also am usually under a time crunch to finish the work on Sunday. Maybe
  the issues are more with my iMac than iMovie, but I’m eager to try some different
  options to see if I can improve my workflow.  Office Apps I purchased iWork not
  long after it came out and have been mostly unimpressed. Numbers in particular lags
  far behind Excel, especially for someone who does a lot of work with groupings and
  pivot tables. Keynote is the best of the iWork apps and I find it very useful for
  making animated storyboards for videos. I think that Microsoft Office is still the
  best office suite for the Mac. It isn’t perfect, but I’m able to co-exist in my
  workplace with an all-Windows world and maintain compatibility. I’m excited for
  the next release and to have Outlook available on the Mac. Productivity    Omnifocus
  - Nearly all of my GTD system lives in Omnifocus. I’ve been an early user since
  their beta and the app has only improved over the years. I also use their iPhone
  app. This is probably my most used application outside of Safari.    Notational
  Velocity, TextMate, SimpleNote, MultiMarkdown - While I was an early adopter of
  the revamped Evernote on the Mac, I continued to grow frustrated with the Windows
  version stability and the closed nature of Evernote’s storage system. I think I
  heard Merlin Mann talk about Notational Velocity and MultiMarkdown on MacBreak Weekly,
  explored the tool, wired things up with SimpleNote and DropBox, and migrated my
  notes from Evernote to plain text. This set of tools has dramatically changed how
  I write and work. I tend to use TextMate more than Notational Velocity for writing,
  but the lightweight nature of Notational Velocity make it great for quick search
  and jotting down ideas.  Utilities    LaunchBar - Switched to this from QuickSilver
  about a year ago and haven’t looked back. Very stable, great power user features,
  and I find myself learning new ways to use it every month.    Hazel - Until I started
  using Hazel I had no idea how much time I spent shuffling files around, moving downloaded
  items to trash, etc. Just started using this 3 months ago and continue to find creative
  uses for it.    TextExpander - I don’t use this as well as I should, but it is a
  great tool and I’m finding some good synergy with MultiMarkdown workflow (inserting
  links from the clipboard, for example).    1Password - This tool let’s me use robust
  unique passwords for sites and integrates very well with DropBox.    DropBox - I
  dropped FolderShare (or whatever Microsoft calls it now) about 12 months ago in
  favor of DropBox. Amazingly robust tool and I’ve converted many family members and
  friends over to its powerful ways. '
