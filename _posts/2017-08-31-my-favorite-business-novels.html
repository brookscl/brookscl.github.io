<p>I was hanging out with a group of my coaching clients last week and made an off-hand remark about how much I enjoy business novels. What is a business novel? A business book focused on a specific category of business learning, packaged as a novel- or novella-length story.</p>
<p>Here are my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iL3n0B">The (New) One Minute Manager</a> – I first read this book in the late 80s and I think it holds up well. This is a short parable to help you learn the basics of situational leadership and giving effective feedback.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2glDGiH">The Goal</a> – I read this around 1997 when I was running the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_execution_system">manufacturing execution system</a> for Micron Technology. One of my internal customers, a process engineer, strongly suggested I read this book to learn more about how they approach cycle time reduction on the manufacturing line. This is a novel that conveys fairly complex mathematical and systems engineering concepts in a digestible way. You don’t need to understand the math to apply most of the principles. tl;dr: (1) find your bottleneck, (2) improve it until it is not your bottleneck anymore, (3) goto step 1.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2glU02C">The Deadline</a> – This book is one of a small few that I would suggest every aspiring software development manager, IT manager, or project manager to read. I think he modeled his book a bit on The Goal, but who cares: it covers great concepts in traditional project management. Worth it even if you are an agilista.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2wlsImq">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a> – <em>Almost made the list: <a href="http://amzn.to/2vINNog">Death by Meeting</a></em>. Patrick Lencioni’s books are most-reads for aspring senior managers and executives.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2grVpbM">The Phoenix Project</a> – In the same family as <em>The Goal</em> and <em>The Deadline</em>, we have a protagonist thrust into a difficult new role and seeking a path to success and enlightenment. This time the subject area is the modern IT field of DevOps.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2vJk7He">The Adventures of an IT Leader</a> – I haven’t finished this book yet, but I know it will make the list. This time the protagonist (why do they always have to be men?) is thrust into a CIO role without having a technology background. I plan to use this as one of my textbooks for a <a href="http://www.wou.edu/wp/brooksc/">class on IT management this coming fall at WOU</a>.</li>
</ul>
