excerpt: "                            Julie and I had a date last night – went out
  for some great             food at the Southpark             Seafood Grill & Wine
  Bar then headed over to the Roseland             Theater for a night with The             Thorns
  and The             Jayhawks.  As I’ve             mentioned before, Julie and I
  are long-time Matthew Sweet fans (we’ve seen             him twice before, and his
  breakthrough album Girlfriend came out right when we got             married), so
  that was the primary draw for us.  The Jayhawks are no slouches             either
  – I’ve been a fan for about 5 years and their new album Rainy             Day Music
  is a classic.  If you are a fan of alt-country (like Uncle Tupelo,             Sun
  Volt, even Lyle Lovett) or harmony groups (CSN, Buffalo Springfield, Beach Boys),
  \            you must check these two groups out.                               Brief
  review of the concert: The Thorns were much better than I expected,             and
  The Jayhawks were a little worse.  It came down to energy and execution –             The
  Thorns were very tight and enthusiastic, while Gary Louris of the Jayhawks seemed
  \            to be having a low-energy night.  I was hoping for at least one song
  from the             combined group – The Thorns covered “Blue” by the Jayhawks
  on their             album, and Matthew Sweet has appeared as a background vocalist
  on several Jayhawks             albums.  Didn’t happen last night though.
