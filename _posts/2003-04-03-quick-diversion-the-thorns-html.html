excerpt: "              I just might be one of Matthew Sweet's greatest         fans. 
  Odds are, you haven't heard of him, but from the moment I first heard Girlfriend,
  \        I was hooked.  His solo career, however, has tailed off over the past 5
  years.          A low point for me was seeing him live for the third time, opening
  for Guided         By Voices.  Matthew should never be an opening act :-)!                    Well,
  he has a new gig: The         Thorns, a sort of joint venture with Pete Droge and
  Shawn Mullin.  Check         out their first single, I         Can't Remember.       "

<p>I just might be one of <a href="http://www.matthewsweet.com">Matthew Sweet's</a> greatest<br />
fans. Odds are, you haven't heard of him, but from the moment I first heard<br />
<em>Girlfriend</em>, I was hooked. His solo career, however, has tailed off over the<br />
past 5 years. A low point for me was seeing him live for the third time,<br />
opening for <a href="http://www.guidedbyvoices.com">Guided By Voices</a>. Matthew should<br />
never be an opening act :-)!</p>
<p>Well, he has a new gig: <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/TheThorns/">The<br />
Thorns</a>, a sort of joint venture<br />
