excerpt: Or should I say evening 2?  The day was spent spending time with Matthew
  while Jacob and his team participated in the regional Destination Imagination tournament
  - they won!  Matthew had baseball tryouts mid-day, so I didn't arrive at Game Storm
  until about 8:00pm.  Dave was scheduled to host a late-night A Game of Thrones session,
  and we were a bit concerned that there would be too many players for a single game. 
  So I committed to bring my own copy and perhaps run a parallel game if necessary. 
  We ended up with 10 players so this worked out perfectly. First a few photos from
  some of the other games happening on Saturday night.        Sid Meier's Civilization
  came out Saturday and Sunday.  Big, long, game with lots of interesting bits.          I
  helped a crew of newbies playing Princes of the Renaissance with a few rules clarifications.
           KC indoctrinates another group into the church of New Eden. Next it was
  time for A Game of Thrones!  As I mentioned, Dave ran one game and I ran the other. 
  In Dave's game (he didn't play), I believe Lannister pulled out the victory with
  Baratheon getting eliminated around turn 8 or 9.  Dave started explaining the rules
  around 9:15 and they were underway by 9:45.  Their game ended around 1:15 or 1:30.        The
  game Dave administered saw Lannister seizing and end-of-game victory with the most
  cities under control. My group was a bit slower getting assembled, so by the time
  I was done explaining the rules (with Kai's help) it was already after 10pm.  This
  was going to be a late night. I played Lannister, KC played Tyrell.  The game opened
  with two rapid musters, so players quickly hit their supply limits.  We also saw
  two early Clash of Kings, but this did not change the order in any of the categories
  significantly.  KC played it slow and conservative, gradually working his way over
  to capture Sunspear for a valuable supply and muster point.  I was able to make
  a decent expansion into Harrenhal and Blackwater, so supply was not going to be
  an issue for me.  My navy certainly was though...        Near the start of the game
  I administered. One of Lannister's biggest challenges is getting bullied around
  in the seas by Greyjoy, and this was no exception.  I made the mistake of investing
  a bit too little in my navy, allowing Greyjoy to eventually wipe out my navy.  Once
  this happens in A Game of Thrones, it is very unusual to see a navy come back. 
  Mine never did. Greyjoy and I continued to harass each other, allowing Stark and
  Tyrell to gradually build up their support base and prepare for long-range sorties
  into our areas.  I nearly was eliminated from the game, but thanks to Tyrell interceding
  to push Greyjoy away from Lannisport, I was able to resurface and at least pester
  the other houses.        Stark and Baratheon prepare for battle. We all agreed to
  keep private diplomacy to a minimum in this game, so there was substantial table
  talk about alliances and threats.  I probably prefer the game to played this way,
  though certainly private discussions certainly fit better with the theme and make
  the game much more of a diplomatic effort. This game was extremely close.  Going
  into the final round, Stark, Baratheon, and Tyrell were all in striking distance
  of victory.  The game ended on a somewhat sour note, however. Stark's final march
  order was an attack from Moat Cailin to Seagard which, if successful, would seal
  victory for Stark.  On a previous march order Stark had abandoned Winterfell (though
  of course it remained under his control) to capture another city.  Stark had superfluous
  units in the attack on Seagard, but marched with all of them still.  Greyjoy was
  forced to retreat, but was able to do so all the way back to Winterfell through
  the use of his western navy.  If Stark had just marched one his footmen to Winterfell
  in addition to the attack on Seagard he would have one the game.  The Stark player
  was pretty upset about this, claiming that he wasn't aware that that sort of retreat
  would be allowed.  Oh well, it was a fun game but a late night - we finished about
  2am.
