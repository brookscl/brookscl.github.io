excerpt: ' Thanks to Travis.  I''m surprised I missed any of these questions.   Rock
  StarYou scored 98%!  You damn rock star. You know all the basics, and if you got
  any wrong, I bet it was that stupid Traveling Wilburys question. Your friends are
  probably intimidated by your knowledge of classic rock and envy your impressive
  collection. When a classic rock song comes on the radio, you can probably identify
  it before the vocals kick in most of the time. You probably get good scores on the
  "maiden name of Clapton''s mom" tests, too.  '
