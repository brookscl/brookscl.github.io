excerpt: " I flew into LA late last night from Portland for the Microsoft PDC conference. 
  My outbound flight was delayed due to slowdowns in the LA area from the fires, and
  I didn't get into LAX until around 1:30am.  The night-time descent through the valley
  and into LA was surreal - we could see the glow from the Simi Valley fires, and
  the smoke permeated the cabin so much that my eyes watered.  I'm glad I'll be spending
  most of my time indoors here - the outside world is hazy and the smell of smoke
  and ash is pervasive.   I lived in LA for a short while back in the early 90s, and
  one distinct memory of the place is a sequence of one natural disaster after another. 
  This is a hardluck state...  "

<p>I flew into LA late last night from Portland for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/">Microsoft PDC</a> conference. My outbound flight was<br />
delayed due to slowdowns in the LA area from the fires, and I didn't get into<br />
LAX until around 1:30am. The night-time descent through the valley and into LA<br />
was surreal - we could see the glow from the Simi Valley fires, and the smoke<br />
permeated the cabin so much that my eyes watered. I'm glad I'll be spending<br />
most of my time indoors here - the outside world is hazy and the smell of<br />
smoke and ash is pervasive.</p>
<p>I lived in LA for a short while back in the early 90s, and one distinct memory<br />
of the place is a sequence of one natural disaster after another. This is a<br />
hardluck state.</p>
