excerpt: "                            I’ve made great progress on development over
  the past week.              Quick status update:                  <![if !supportLists]>
  \            ·         <![endif]>Core             engine is essentially complete. 
  At least complete enough that I feel good moving             on to the first UI.
  \                 <![if !supportLists]>             ·         <![endif]>The             scoring
  algorithm was a bit tricky, but turned out to be very similar to the expropriation
  \            algorithm.  In fact, I’m going to be looking for some refactoring opportunities
  \            in both sets of code.  What I really need is a “street traversal visitor”
  \            of some sort, but I haven’t thought it through enough yet.                  <![if
  !supportLists]>             ·         <![endif]>I’m             up to about 30 unit
  tests right now – they’ve been instrumental in supporting             some pretty
  heavy refactoring efforts.                  <![if !supportLists]>             ·        
  <![endif]>My             first UI will just be a standalone, Windows forms, hot-seat
  client to validate overall             gameplay.                  <![if !supportLists]>
  \            ·         <![endif]>My             next UI will probably be a web-based,
  real-time interface.                  <![if !supportLists]>             ·        
  <![endif]>Finally,             I plan to make a winforms-based networked real-time
  interface.  Hmmm… maybe             I’ll use web services for the client protocol.
  \                              I might post another source drop this weekend in
  case anyone wants             to see the core engine.  I’ve got two weeks of vacation
  coming up at Keuka             Lake so I hope to have a working beta by the time
  I get back.                                               "
