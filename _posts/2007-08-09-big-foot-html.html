excerpt: " So Gabby, our new kitten, is supposed to have larger than normal (for a
  cat) paws.  This morning Julie noticed that one paw was larger than the other, took
  her to the vet, and discovered that she had likely been stung by a bee or wasp.
  \   No, that isn't a perspective trick.  Notice the enlarged right paw.  She's on
  some meds now and is recovering nicely. "
