excerpt: 'I learned about the game Viktory II listening to The Dice Tower recently. 
  Tom’s glowing remarks and the mention of 660 miniatures certainly perked up my ears,
  so I did some research.  The article written by designer Peter Morrison on the Making
  of Viktory II is certainly worth a read.  We put a lot of work into the production
  of Havoc: the Hundred Years War, but that was nothing compared to Peter’s efforts.'

<p>I learned about the game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/23950">Viktory II</a> listening to The Dice Tower recently.  Tom's glowing remarks and the mention of 660 miniatures certainly perked up my ears, so I did some research.  The article written by designer <a href="http://www.morrisongames.com/about_peter_morrison.htm">Peter Morrison</a> on the <a href="http://www.viktorygame.com/viktoryiihistory/">Making of Viktory II</a> is certainly worth a read.  We put a lot of work into the production of <a href="http://www.sunrivergames.com/havoc/">Havoc: the Hundred Years War</a>, but that was <em>nothing</em> compared to Peter's efforts. </p>
