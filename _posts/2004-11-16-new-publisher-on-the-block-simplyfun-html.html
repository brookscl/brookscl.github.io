excerpt: 'Found on Gamewire: there''s a new game publisher starting up called SimplyFun.Â 
  They have an interesting business model:  The company won''t be selling their games
  online or through retailers, instead they will be signing up individuals to market
  their games using a similar model to Tupperware or The Pampered Chef.  Also interesting:
  Jeremy Young and Matt Molen of Uberplay are listed as the VP of Product Dev and
  VP of Marketing, respectively.'
