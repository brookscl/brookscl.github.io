excerpt: "              We spent a great weekend in Newport, OR.  Our hotel was         on
  the beach and the weather was perfect - 60s and sunny during the day.  Friday         we
  took the behind the scenes         tour at the Oregon Coast Aquarium - I highly
  \        recommend this, especially if you've been there before and want to try
  something new.          One highlight of the trip was sampling the various brews
  from Rogue         brewery - I highly recommend the Yellow Snow Ale and the Buckwheat
  Ale.          The other big highlight was seeing migrating grey whales on our whale
  watching cruise         with Marine Discovery Tours.  Jacob         and Matthew
  each got turns at the helm of the ship.       "
