<p>Now that I've talked about what's coming up next, it's time to talk about how I'll manage to keep playing games while being away from my collection for nearly 5 months! At least I have the luxury of driving to New York, so I hopefully can afford to carry one of my plastic bins. This probably means I leave the golf clubs behind though. </p>
<p>So I have to plan for two different scenarios: having an adequately diverse set of options for the 2+ months I'll spend at Keuka Lake along with a compact gaming kit for our 7 weeks of backpacking in Ireland. I'm already mostly packed up so what I'm sharing will be just a peek but not a full display. Let's start with the small container.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/17919054255" title="The little box of games by Chris Brooks, on Flickr"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/05/17919054255_5e32dc07e6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The little box of games" /></a></p>
<p>Here's what I've got:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu">Tichu</a> -- my favorite partnership game for four people. This won't go to Ireland because the learning curve is too great for new players and Julie and I will most likely just be playing two player games.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter">Love Letter</a> -- quick fun and easy to teach to new players.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/81453/famiglia">Famiglia</a> -- I like this underrated two player set collection game.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147020/star-realms">Star Realms</a> -- that's what you see in the brown plastic box. This game comes in a crappy box hence the switch. I've mostly played the iOS game but hoping Julie will like it face to face. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8129/zing">Die Sieben Siegel</a> -- Sometimes you have five players and want to play a trick taking game. That's why you carry this one.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game">Bang! The Dice Game</a> -- I'm a long time fan of Bang! but it can run on for too long. This has enough of the fun of the original in a much quicker game.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11/bohnanza">Bohnanza</a> -- There's a lot of game in this small package, and it scales well to 5 or 6 players. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8217/san-juan">San Juan</a> -- One of those games that I'll always play.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2013/1/25/the-many-uses-of-a-sticheln-deck">My Sticheln universal gaming pack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi">Hanabi</a> -- This game is so unique and I look forward to trying it out with guests at the lake. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's take a look at the bigger box. Moving around we can see the first side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/17298586933" title="Mythotopia, Richard III, and more by Chris Brooks, on Flickr"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/05/17298586933_94a7db7e51_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Mythotopia, Richard III, and more" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133632/mythotopia">Mythotopia</a> -- I want a few heavier multi-player games and this was my pick. I've only played it once, but I love the deck-building-and-wargame mashup.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25277/richard-iii-wars-roses">Richard III</a> -- <a href="http://jim.ginn5j.com/">Jim</a> and I like to play a wargame when he comes out to Keuka, and we played this one earlier this year. I think it is better than Hammer of the Scots and am eager to play it again.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172/sale">For Sale</a> -- One of my top 10 all time games. Easy to teach and quick to play.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur">Jaipur</a> -- This is one of the main two player games Julie and I have been playing. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1353/times">Time's Up</a> -- One of our favorite party games that can scale up real well because you can build teams with more than two players. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66056/rivals-catan">Rivals for Catan</a> with Age of Enlightenment expansion -- When Julie and I want a two player game with a bit more depth, this is one of our favorites. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders">7 Wonders</a> with Leaders expansion -- Evergreen game and a Keuka Lake tradition.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/17916006682" title="Dixit, Castles of Burgandy, and more by Chris Brooks, on Flickr"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/05/17916006682_5de4441b16_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Dixit, Castles of Burgundy, and more" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit">Dixit</a> -- Easy to teach social / party game. Good with a bottle of wine or whiskey. There are several expansions packed in this box.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy">The Castles of Burgundy</a> -- One of the better Euro games to come out in the past few years. Alternate for Mythotopia when folks don't want to fight.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122298/morels">Morels</a> -- Along with Jaipur one of the main two player games for Julie and me. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147949/one-night-ultimate-werewolf">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</a> and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38159/ultimate-werewolf-ultimate-edition">Ultimate Werewolf</a> -- These are both packed in the same box. I have a feeling without Matthew being at Keuka most of the summer that these may not get played much, but I want the option.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24480/pillars-earth">The Pillars of the Earth</a> -- One of my favorite worker placement games. Hoping to try this two player with Julie.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbrooks/17298593403" title="Magic, Game of Thrones LCG, Havoc, and more by Chris Brooks, on Flickr"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/05/17298593403_e38e66a08d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Magic, Game of Thrones LCG, Havoc, and more" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/86156/reverse-charades">Reverse Charades</a> -- A fun party game that we enjoyed out at the lake last year. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19363/havoc-hundred-years-war">Havoc</a> -- Of course I'll bring Havoc.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34219/biblios">Scripts and Scribes</a> - Has some similarities to For Sale but with some unique twists. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> -- Always bring Magic.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39953/game-thrones-card-game">A Game of Thrones Card Game</a> -- Probably wishful thinking that this will get out, but perhaps Jim will join me. </li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/432/category-5">6 Nimmt!</a> -- Fun multiplayer light card game.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/44/david-goliath">David and Goliath</a> -- I've been wanting to get this one the table but I suspect it will remain in the shadow of Tichu and Die Sieben.</li>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/88253/unconditional-surrender-case-blue">Unconditional Surrender: Case Blue</a> and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33030/drive-metz-second-edition">Drive on Metz</a> -- These are two ziploc war games that I can fit in my case. They are both suitable for solitaire play and perhaps I can find an opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's it. I've got party games, card games, war games, collectible card games, a decent range of Euros, and plenty of two player games.  I'm not sure what I'll bring to Ireland, but for sure I'll bring the Sticheln kit. </p>
