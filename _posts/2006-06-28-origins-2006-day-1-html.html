excerpt: 'I’m able to mix some business with pleasure this week.  I’m here in Columbus,
  OH doing some customer visits but I’ll be able to squeeze in about 2 days at the
  Origins International Game Expo.  I’ve got some more work to do tomorrow morning,
  but starting Thursday afternoon I’m free for some gaming until late Friday afternoon
  when I fly back to Portland. Tom Vasel and I made a date a few weeks ago to have
  dinner tonight.  We hooked up in the Board Room hosted by the Columbus Area Boardgaming
  Society (CABS) at about 4:30.  Also there was the omnipresent (and omniscient?)
  Rick Thornquist.  We chatted for a bit while Rick and some others wrapped up a game
  of GemBlo.  Tom’s been in country for about 2 weeks, spending his time up until
  now with family in Pennsylvania.  He returns across the Pacific to Korea in about
  a week.  Tom, Rick, and I then hopped in my car to drive over to Valerie Putman’s
  home for some fellowship and BBQ.  Met some interesting folks there, including the
  infamous Mr. Cranky and Jay Tummelson.  After dinner it was time to return to the
  gaming hall.  Rick, Michael Pennisi, and I sat down to try out the new Mayfair Games
  release Bison.  This is a tile-laying area majority game with some interesting elements. 
  The game is very action constrained (this is a Kramer / Kiesling game, after all)
  and has some bizarre scoring elements – it isn’t uncommon for the player that finished
  3rd in the majority to score more points than the 2nd player.  It sort of made sense,
  and I’m interested in playing again to see how I can play better given a better
  understanding of the system.  The components are pretty nice, but the theme is pretty
  thin and the game feels abstract.  I was hoping for bison miniatures but I only
  saw cardboard tiles and wooden cubes.  Halfway through the game I was a bit turned
  off – it felt like a Colovini game with a touch of Trias.  It did improve as we
  finished and I’d like to try it again, though I doubt it will be a purchase.  We
  finished in a dead-heat with 26 points each, with Michael and I also in a tie for
  the tie-breaker.  We had identical scores, though he claimed since he had more bison
  points than I that he should win. '
