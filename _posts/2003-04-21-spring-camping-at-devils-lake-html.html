excerpt: "              We took the short trip to Lincoln City,         OR this weekend
  for some yurt camping         at Devils Lake.  Tent         camping in the spring
  in Oregon is always a risk (unless you like lying in mud), so         rather than
  stay home we've started exploring the various         state parks that offer yurts. 
  Hardly roughing it, but we still cook outside,         make s'mores by the campfire,
  and explore the waterways in our canoe.  I         also took some pictures with
  my new Nikon Coolpix 2500 digital camera.                    Devils Lake was much
  more interesting than I expected.  The fishing was great         - we landed 6 decent
  size hatchery rainbows (all catch and release with the exception         of one
  poor guy that didn't survive a hook swallow - we gave him to our camping neighbors).
