excerpt: " I'm sitting here at a coffee shop in downtown Hammondsport, NY uploading
  some photographs for an online photography course I'm taking over at BetterPhoto.com.
  \ We're having a blast as usual on Keuka Lake.  Waterskiing, tubing, just hanging
  out.  Jacob caught a lunker 21 inch lake trout early Monday morning that we ate
  for lunch.  We may go out again Friday morning to get enough for a fish fry Friday
  night.    This really is a special place for us and we regret not making it last
  summer.  We are trying to work out a plan for next summer that would allow us to
  spend 6 weeks here next summer - this would involve a significant change in baseball
  plans.  The goal is to teach the boys some stewardship for the cottages and get
  deep into the area, including attending the local Boy Scout summer camp nearby on
  a neighboring lake."
