excerpt: 'The game classes have been a good success, even resulting in the conversion
  of a few families to full-time game geeks.  Julie is running the Wednesday class
  for 3/4 graders, and I handle the Thursday class for 4/5 graders.  After each class
  we have the kids rate the games and we now have a ranking of the games the kids
  have played so far:  Saboteur / TransEuropa (tie) Pickomino / Family Fluxx (tie)
  Walk the Dogs Take it Easy Not that any of the kids don''t like these games - they
  are all rating very highly (Take it Easy is at a 3.6 on Chuck''s 4 point scale). 
  Julie and I agree that the true test is what games the kids ask for on the periodic
  open gaming session where they get to pick and choose.  I think their choices align
  with the ratings above, though Walk the Dogs is probably a bit closer to 1st or
  2nd place.  As we get towards the end of the year and start doing end-of-year open
  sessions I''ll report back on their choices. Here''s what we have on tap for coming
  weeks:  Carcassonne: the Discovery Bohnanza (probably the last game we''ll do as
  it is the most complex) Incan Gold 24/7: the Game'
