excerpt: 'Julie and I hosted an all-day gaming event/party at our home in Sherwood
  on Dec 13.  I invited all of my usual gaming buddies plus the folks over at Rip
  City Gamers, a local gaming group.  I also took the opportunity to invite a few
  folks from work that are into boardgames.  The result was about 20 people at our
  house from 1pm until the last straggler left around 11pm.  There were a ton of games
  played.  I''ll provide a lot of pictures here along with links to the games, but
  I can only provide commentary on the games I played.  In the future I might adopt
  a system like Greg Schloesser''s - he hands a slip of paper to each group of players
  playing a game and has them write a brief summary, final scores, and player ratings
  from 1-10 for the game.  This makes for much more complete session reports, and
  he has some great data to track game quality (and we love data, right?). Liar''s
  Dice Dave and George showed up promptly at 1pm, so we started with a game of Liar''s
  Dice until more folks arrived.  Of course as soon as we would start to play, new
  people would arrive and so we would stop, explain the rules, and start over.  By
  the time we actually started the real game, we had 10 people playing (I used both
  a Liar''s Dice box and a Perudo set to give enough cups and dice).  To accelerate
  the game, we played the following variants:  If you lose a challenge, you lose a
  number of dice equal to the delta between the bet and the actual.  So if I bet 10
  5''s but only 8 are on the board, I lose 2 dice.  If the bet is exactly correct
  (e.g., I bet 10 5''s and there are exactly 10), then all players beside the bettor
  lose a die. Some people dropped out quickly due to bad luck (when there are 50 dice
  in the game, it isn''t hard to miss by 5 die). The game wrapped up in about 30 minutes
  - I think it was down to me and George at the end, with George coming out on top.
  Triple Crown George brought out this vintage (1988) horse racing game - Dave, Jeremy,
  and I joined in.  Each player gets a horse and secretly writes down whether he hopes
  to win, place, or show in the race.  Three races are played in all (hence the name
  of the game).  Starting gate order is determined randomly for each race. On each
  turn, the player with the horse in front (ties go to the horse on the outside) goes
  first.  The player can choose from any of three dice (slow, medium, or fast).   If
  you use the slow dice, you get a payoff coupon that pays a great return for win,
  place, and slow.  The fast die, of course, will get you farther but with a lower
  payoff.  So the basic idea of the game is to first decide how aggressive you want
  to be (your secret goal) then to move at an optimal speed where you maximize your
  position and payoff.        George, Dave, and Jeremy preparing to bet on the ponies.
  There is still the random element of the die roll, and it bit me twice.  In two
  of the three races, I was three or four spaces away from the finish line.  I made
  the decision to use a slower die that gave me a 5 in 6 chance of crossing the finish
  line but would of course provide a better payoff.  Both times I rolled the lowest
  number possible, didn''t cross the line, and saw my opponents'' horses cross in
  front of me.  I ended the triple crown with no money, and George won the overall
  crown.  I''m no Seabiscuit. Carcassonne Kevin and Mike played a game of Carcassonne
  while Jim watched.  Jim is very new to these sorts of boardgames and is quickly
  getting indoctrinated.  For some reason my kids don''t enjoy this game so I rarely
  get to play it.  This game included a huge set of tiles, including Rivers, Inns
  & Cathedrals, and Builders & Traders.        Mike, Jim, and Kevin play Carcassonne.
  Medina Yes, yet another time where I get to watch someone else play this game without
  ever trying it myself.  Next time I game with Kevin I''m going to play it!        Kevin,
  Dave, and Jeremy contemplate their next move in Medina. Bridges of Shangri-La This
  new Uberplay game was brought out - very nice looking.  The game is not getting
  the best reviews - in fact, some folks on spielfrieks are saying it is one the bigger
  disappointments of the year.  I still would like to try it and judge for myself. 
  Jeremy won, followed by Kevin, Mike and Jim. Mike really likes this game. It is
  fairly easy to teach, yet some thought is required. “I find it in the same mold
  as Trias, another of my favorites, which also requires some thinking. I guess that
  is what ''dry'' means!“        KC, George, and Mike play Bridges of Shangri-La.
  Piratenbucht Aaarrrgh!  This favorite of Matthew''s came out, and I quickly taught
  Brandon, Kara, and Kim how to play.  For such an apparently simple game, the rules
  are a bit complex and there is much to remember.  I haven''t yet tried the newer
  English language Days of Wonder version.        Brandon, Matthew, Kara, and Kim
  rattle sabers in Piratenbucht. Puerto Rico This game started around 1:30pm and went
  on for at least two hours.  I can''t remember who won, but Jacob told me he finished
  in last place, way behind the leader Doug.        Greg, Jason, Doug, Jacob, and
  Ken play Puerto Rico. Corsairs I tried to teach this quickly to George, KC, and
  Kim, then realized I just hadn''t played enough to have the rules locked down in
  my head.  Luckily KC is good with rules and quickly caught the rest of the group
  up.  This is an OK game - fairly simple to play, but it hasn''t come out much since
  I bought it last spring.        Kim, George, and KC play Corsairs. Metro Bill brought
  this transportation game - I''m dying to try it, but didn''t get a chance this day
  even though it was played twice.        Greg, Dave, Doug, Tony, Jason, and Ken play
  Metro. Settlers of Catan - Cities and Knights Much of my time was spent playing
  the Cities and Knights expansion to Settlers of Catan.  I''ve been playing the online
  version quite a bit lately and when Bill suggested this I jumped at the chance. 
  So Julie, Bill, Wendy and I settled down for a game - this expansion can take quite
  a while to play - ours lasted around 2.5 hours.        Julie, Bill, and Wendy join
  me in a game of Cities and Knights of Catan. This expansion adds a number of elements
  to the basic game of Settlers:  Periodically the barbarians invade, so players must
  recruit knights to protect their cities  Commodities (essentially finished goods
  derived from basic resources) are produced from some of the cities in addition to
  resources  Walls can be built that allow players to hold more cards in hand without
  being robbed  Players can use commodities to upgrade their economies, giving additional
  benefits and potentially granting victory points Despite the longer playing time,
  I like this expansion very much.  The main reason is that there are usually more
  options on each turn.  One thing I don''t like about the basic game is that very
  often a player has nothing to do on a turn - not the case in this expansion.        Final
  board configuration - I was Orange. I managed to win the race to 12 victory points. 
  I was awarded a couple Defender of Catan victory point cards plus I managed to get
  a Metropolis. Foppen I don''t know much about this trick taking game by Friedmann
  Friese.        Kim, KC, Mike, Kevin, and Jeremy play Foppen. For Sale After Foppen,
  Jeremy taught For Sale to the same group.  Don''t know who won. Wyatt Earp I refreshed
  a few folks on the rules to this great rummy variant (my favorite).        Ken,
  Greg, Jim, and Tony play Wyatt Earp. Metro Metro came out again.        Julie, Bill,
  Greg (#2), and Wendy play Metro. New England I purchased this recently but hadn''t
  yet played my version - my first and only play was with the Arizona Boardgamers
  back in September.  It didn''t disappoint - I really like this game.  It is very
  easy to learn, but I look forward to exploring different strategies.  I initially
  started to go for a pilgrim advantage, thinking that the early income would help
  and if I can maintain the lead it would be worth some nice victory points.  But
  KC was able to race ahead so I focused my efforts elsewhere.  I got some nice card
  draws that let me build 3- and 4- tile configurations, and I jumped into the lead. 
  I thought I had plenty of breathing room on the last turn, but just in case I built
  a barn to pull into a tie for the most with KC and Jim, nullifying their advantage. 
  I was lucky I did - I only ended up winning by a single victory point over KC.        KC,
  Jim, and Chris play New England. What the Kids Did Most of the Afternoon Just had
  to include this photo.  Jacob, Matthew, Brandon, and Kara played some games early
  on, then retired to the playroom for some good old fashioned make believe.         Jacob,
  Matthew, Brandon, and Kara defend their playroom fort. KC''s Prototype: New Eden
  This was the highlight of the day for me.  KC Humphry has designed a very good game
  that I am eager to play again.  I''m running out of time here so I won''t describe
  it in full - I hope to play again on Dec 29th, and if I do I''ll write up a more
  detailed review.        KC teaches Jim and me New Eden Players take the role of
  leaders that are settling and terra-forming a new planet, competing with each other
  for geography and agriculture.  Players have farmers and workers - farmers place
  and harvest farms (surprise), while workers carry out activities specified on action
  cards.  There are some very creative mechanics in this game, and the use of action
  cards as some interesting choices and great flavor.        Action cards in New Eden.
  KC is a great teacher and was very patient as we picked up the basics and started
  to move into strategy and tactics.  I managed to win the game, but I suspect KC
  was pulling some punches with us newbies.  I can''t wait to play this again and
  I hope KC finds a means to publish this game. Sticheln Ken, KC, and I wrapped up
  the evening with this perplexing trick taking game.  The game is perplexing because
  trump is always whatever suit is not lead, and because each player is trying to
  avoid taking tricks in their own chosen poison suit.  I never quit managed to figure
  out some of the tactics for how to play my cards - you do want to take tricks (that''s
  how you score points), but it can be a challenge to dump cards on your opponents
  and avoid taking your own poison suit.  I''d like to play this again, though my
  initial impression was not as strong as Die Sieben Siegel.'
