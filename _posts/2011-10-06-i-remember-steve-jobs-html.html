<p>I can't fully explain the impact Steve Jobs had on my life, but I can at least share a chronology of memories directly linked to his creations.</p>
<p>I remember first learning that my friend Mike was getting an Apple II computer when we were in the 6th or 7th grade and being extremely jealous.  I made it clear to him that he'd need someone who knew how to program in BASIC to help him operate it (that being me of course).  I remember scrambling to learn BASIC so I could prove my worth.</p>
<p>I remember spending late nights at Mike's house playing Wizardry and Olympic Decathlon, then staying up even later after Mike went to sleep learning how to "enter the monitor" with <a href="http://apple2.info/wiki/index.php?title=System_Monitor#How_to_enter_the_System_Monitor">Call -151</a> and start programming 6502 assembler language.</p>
<p>I remember encountering my first Macintosh as a sophomore in high school in 1984 and using it alongside a PDP-11.  It was clear that the world was changing.</p>
<p>I remember programming my own version of Tetris on a Mac during my sophomore year in college using 68000 assembly language. I remember using a Mac IIcx to produce many term papers during my senior year in college.  I remember designing a medical imaging system as a senior project based on the NeXT computing platform.</p>
<p>I left the Mac world for at least 15 years, but I remember coming back in a flurry in 2007 with a MacBook Pro, an iPhone, and an iMac.  Since then the Apple virus has consumed our household and we are better off for it.  Steve Jobs -- you will be dearly missed.</p>
