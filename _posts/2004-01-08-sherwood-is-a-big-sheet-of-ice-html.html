excerpt: The weather here has been nothing short of remarkable.  The schools still
  haven't re-opened, and I didn't even attempt to get into work today.  The warmup
  predicted yesterday never came, and the temperatures hovered around freezing all
  day.  Around 6pm I finally ventured outside to clear the sidewalk.  Looks like schools
  will be closed again tomorrow - my trip to Denver was called off.  Should start
  to warmup by mid-day tomorrow.        Notice the "shiny snow" - that's a layer about
  2 inches thick of solid ice.
