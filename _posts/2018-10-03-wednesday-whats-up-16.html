<h2 id="whatimreading">What I’m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>I listened to <a href="https://amzn.to/2zO2xX5">The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War</a> and found it to be educational and entertaining. Very much an indictment of MacArthur and Almond, with heaping praise for Ridgway.</li>
<li>I also listened to <a href="https://amzn.to/2IC7iGj">Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhower’s Final Mission</a> which is presumably about three key days of transition from Eisenhower to Kennedy. It was more of a light biography with heaping praise for Eisenhower and somewhat of an indictment of Kennedy for his poor preparation for the office and dismissive views of Ike’s experience and wisdom. It wasn’t bad but I want to seek some more Ike sources to learn more.</li>
<li>In my efforts to improve my higher ed teaching, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2NmpqVg">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</a>. I liked the book enough to also purchase a hard copy to keep as a reference. Applying several of the suggestions to my courses this term.</li>
<li>While driving solo from Nebraska to Oregon I finally listened to Gaiman’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2NmVZm9">The Graveyard Book</a>. What a treat! Highly recommend for old and young adults.</li>
<li>I enjoyed listening to the highly researched <a href="https://amzn.to/2IAQrU3">Indianapolis: The True Story of the Worst Sea Disaster in U.S. Naval History and the Fifty-Year Fight to Exonerate an Innocent Man</a>. Julie and I also watched the documentary produced by one of the authors: don’t bother as it was poorly edited and lacking a coherent narrative. Book is much better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I’m Playing</h2>
<p>Almost nothing! School and football have kept me very busy. Julie had a deck of cards while we were at a bar so we endeavored to learn how to really play <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/31164454">Gin Rummy</a>, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy">rules we found on Wikipedia</a>. Turns out we’ve been playing it wrong all these years - the knocking rules with option to push your luck and go out without full melds changes the game in a great way.</p>
