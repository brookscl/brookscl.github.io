<h2 id="whatimcontemplating">What I&#8217;m Contemplating</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ournextlife.com/2019/01/07/one-year-lessons/">One Year of Early Retirement, Part 1: Biggest Lessons</a> &#8211; I like reading these narratives, if only to compare notes and see if others&#8217; &#8220;early retirement&#8221; feels as non-retirement as mine does (in a good way!).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getrichslowly.org/am-i-financially-independent/">Am I financially independent? (And does it matter?)</a> &#8211; I need to meet JD someday - we are in the same town. Lots to agree with here, particularly the hinting that a small income can have a huge impact on offsetting the risk of depleting retirement assets.</li>
<li><a href="https://acquisitiontalk.com/2018/11/how-to-save-1-trillion-on-defense-spending/">How to save $1 trillion on defense spending</a> &#8211; I could get behind option 3.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2380751/sunscreen-sun-exposure-skin-cancer-science">Is Sunscreen the New Margarine?</a> &#8211; I take vitamin D right now (shouldn&#8217;t most Oregonians?) but will keep an eye on this research.</li>
<li><a href="https://avc.com/2019/01/capitalism-and-inequality/">Capitalism and Inequality â€“ AVC</a> &#8211; Fred sums up my views on capitalism.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moreonteachingprocessimprovement">More on Teaching Process Improvement</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://teddysvoronos.com/2015/11/19/in-praise-of-goodnotes/">In Praise of GoodNotes</a> &#8211; This is close to the method I use in class. I have an automated workflow that allows me to quickly upload my notes to <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> at the end of class. I&#8217;ve almost moved completely away from using slides.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/goodnotes-5-the-macstories-review/">GoodNotes 5: The MacStories Review</a> &#8211; The latest update is pretty sweet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimreading">What I&#8217;m Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Julie and I listened to <a href="https://amzn.to/2WzUA15">Last Christmas in Paris: A Novel of World War I</a> and adored it. The book might be good to read, but I would recommend the audio book as it has narrators for each part and the voice acting is spectacular.</li>
<li>I also listened to <a href="https://amzn.to/2sWGNnE">Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done</a> and it was much better than expected. The lessons here even carried over into some of my lectures, namely the idea of how a desire for perfection can be an inhibitor to taking risks on speculative projects.</li>
<li>I continued the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/112296-the-broken-earth">Broken Earth trilogy</a> with book 2, <a href="https://amzn.to/2To1zbH">The Obelisk Gate</a>. I have some ideas about how this trilogy might end, but the journey remains worth the ride.</li>
<li>I listened to <a href="https://amzn.to/2sZI918">Fascism: A Warning</a> and it was worth my time, if only to hear a more modern definition of fascism along with current examples of fascist traits in world leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimwatching">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7905466/">They Shall Not Grow Old</a> &#8211; Peter Jackson&#8217;s documentary where he applies his wizardry to WWI footage to create a narrative about infantry serving on the Western front. The technical attributes were jaw dropping. They adjusted frame rates and added audio where it made sense. Felt like I was getting a better sense for how the soldiers related. Made them seem much fresher and younger, almost modern. Sadly the story itself wasn&#8217;t compelling. Didn&#8217;t get to know any soldiers or feel real attachment to them. Ken Burns should partner with Peter Jackson next time.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6587094/">Five Came Back</a> &#8211; About five directors who &#8220;signed up&#8221; to make movies during WWII, sometimes putting themselves in harm&#8217;s way. Often restaging pitched battles to get the shots they wanted. The narration is what makes this film, particularly Spielberg&#8217;s, Kasdan&#8217;s, and Guillermo del Toro. It also created a new list of movies to watch for me, fortunately many of them available at my local library.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/">BlackkKlansman</a> &#8211; Julie and I were both &#8220;meh&#8221; on this. Maybe our expectations were too high? It felt uneven; like it started off trying to be somewhat serious and straight-line with the protagonist, but then tried to become a bit of a satire and farce. The characters around the police station made no sense to me. They were either too socially progressive or too over-the-top racist. I suspect this was Spike Lee&#8217;s intent, but it just didn&#8217;t work for us.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatimplaying">What I&#8217;m Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/33289852">Combat Commander: Europe</a> with Peter and we are doing a rematch of the same scenario today, switching sides.</li>
<li>Julie and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224037/codenames-duet">Codenames Duet</a> four times and finally got a win. Turns out we were playing the time tokens slightly wrong which made the game a bit harder. Still a great challenge and I suspect it scales well to up to 4 players.</li>
<li>Of course I played some <a href="http://www.multimanpublishing.com/">Advanced Squad Leader</a> including continuing my <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/254682/hatten-flames">Hatten in Flames</a> campaign with Allen.</li>
<li>Ken taught Spence and I how to play <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177736/feast-odin">A Feast for Odin</a> and I liked it so much I bought it at <a href="http://www.ggportland.com/">Guardian Games</a> last weekend. Playing again this Sunday.</li>
<li>Julie and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo">King of Tokyo</a> with Spence and Suzanne (twice!). Fun light game. We also played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150/pitchcar">PitchCar</a> (actually the older Carabande, but same game.)</li>
<li>The game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144733/russian-railroads">Russian Railroads</a> has been on my &#8220;want to play&#8221; list for over 5 years and Julie and I finally played last Sunday at Guardian. Glad I played it but there are enough similar games that I think I like more (Viticulture, A Feast for Odin)</li>
<li>I taught Julie the light 2 player game <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163412/patchwork">Patchwork</a> and it was fun. Maybe need to get this one.</li>
<li>Julie and I played <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128621/viticulture">Viticulture</a> twice over the past two nights. Attempt 1 was frustrating for Julie - had been 3 years since she played and she was a bit tired and lost. She bounced back like a true champion last night and won the game.</li>
