<p>It is almost July 4 weekend and I feel like I'm not even where I normally am by June 1 in terms of opening and key projects. We just got the raft anchored and floated after recovering our two lost anchors from last season.</p>

<p>The clasp pins worked loose but the anchors (Lowes buckets filled with cement and a long U bolt) are still in good shape. We've since learned the value of zip ties to keep pin from rotating out.</p>
<p>My big projects to finish before I feel I can move on to activities are a big repair job on the Flying Dutchman and some cleanout from under the yellow cottage. That huge pile of wood came from under. Some will be saved, some will be used for camp fires.</p>
