excerpt: 'I played a quick solitaire game of Vanished Planet tonight to acquaint myself
  with the rules and get a feel for the game play.  Maybe I''ll write a review after
  I get a chance to play it with the boys this weekend, but for now I''ll share a
  few first impressions:  This game is difficult.  I played on the easiest setting
  and lost, though I was close.  There is a countdown effect similar to Sauron approaching
  the fellowship in the Lord of the Rings Boardgame. There are some human factors
  issues with the game.  I found it very difficult to read the symbols for the different
  resource and personnel types.  There is too much use of dark colors like black and
  purple with too little contrast. The quick reference on the back of the rules could
  use some work.  For example, the symbols for the professions should be shown next
  to each profession since they are referred to in the purchase cost for some of the
  technologies. There are too many levels of indirection in the game, which leads
  to a certain fiddlyness.  I''m sure this will become more natural over time, but
  simple things like distinguishing between a trade station or research station can
  be tough. Why not just use the resource symbols for these locations on the game
  board?  Or use an iconic representation that would look good on the map but still
  be appropriate for use on the cards. I didn''t realize until too late that the creature
  will eat the satellites fairly early in the game, which put me in a bind.  I only
  had one goal by the time they were consumed, which made it nearly impossible to
  win.  I had to spend too many resources to build a Communications Relay so that
  I could retrieve goals from my home planet.  Had I been able to save those resources
  for the actual goals I would have won the game. The rules could use some work -
  the specifics seem to be bit scattered around the main rules, the tutorial, and
  the quick reference. These notes are mostly negative, but I did enjoy the solitaire
  play and look forward to trying it with a group.'
