I was previously the SVP of Technology at WebMD and the CTO at Corillian, now a 
part of CheckFree and Fiserv. Now I teach part-time at Western Oregon University 
and do interim technology leadership and coaching.

I've lived all over the country but lived in the Portland, Oregon area from 
1998 to 2020. I'm into coaching American football, board games, 
photography, and travel.

I live at Keuka Lake, NY most of the year and wander the globe when I'm not 
there.
